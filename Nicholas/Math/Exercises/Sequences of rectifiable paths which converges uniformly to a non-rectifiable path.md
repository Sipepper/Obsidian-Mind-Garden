>[!dsn] Body of the problem 
>- Show that if a sequence of paths $c_{n}:[a,b]\to X$ converges uniformly to a path $c$ and $\limsup_{n}l(c_{n})$ is finite, then $c$ is rectifiable.
>- Find a sequence of rectifiable paths $c_{n}:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ converging uniformly to a non-rectifiable path $c$.^[Martin R. Bridson, Andre Haefliger - "Metric spaces of non-positive curvature" p.14]
