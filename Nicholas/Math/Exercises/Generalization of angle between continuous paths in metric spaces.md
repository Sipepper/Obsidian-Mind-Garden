>[!dsn] Body of the problem
>Generalize definition of [[Angle between the geodesic paths]] to give a notion of (upper) angle between arbitrary continuous paths that issue from the same point in an arbitrary metric space and do not return to that point. Then adapt the proof of the preceding proposition so that it applies to this more general situation.
