>[!dsn] Body of the problem
>Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and $\tau$ the topology induced on $X$ by $d$. Let $Y$ be a subset of $X$ and $d_{1}$ the metric on $Y$ obtained by restricting $d$; that is, $d_{1}(a,b)=d(a,b)$ for all $a,b\in Y$. If $\tau_{1}$ is the topology induced on $Y$ by $d_{1}$ and $\tau_{2}$ is the subspace topology on $Y$, prove that $\tau_{1}=\tau_{2}$.^[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears p.135]

>This shows that *every subspace of a metrizable space is metrizable*.
