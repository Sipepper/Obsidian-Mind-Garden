>A *tiling* consists of a connected compact subset $P$ of the Euclidean plane $E$ and a subgroup $G$ of the group $\text{Is}^{+}(E)$ of orientation-preserving isometries of $E$, such that the interior $\text{Int}(P)$ of $P$ is non-empty and the following conditions are satisfied
>1. $$\bigcup\limits_{g\in G}g(P)=E$$
>2. $$g(P)=h(P)\text{ whenever }g(\text{Int}(P))\cap h(\text{Int}(P))\ne\emptyset$$
>
>The group $G$ is called a *crystallographic group*.^[Marcel Berger - "Geometry 1" p.13]
