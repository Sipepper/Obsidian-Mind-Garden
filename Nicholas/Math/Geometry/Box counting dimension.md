>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $F$ be a bounded non-empty subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and let $N_{\delta}(F)$ be the smallest number of sets which covers $F$ with diameter at most $\delta$. By *lower* and *upper box-counting dimension*(*Minkowski-Bouligand dimension*) of a set $F$ we mean the following expressions:
>$$\underline\dim_{B}F=\underline\lim\limits_{\delta\to0}\frac{\log N_{\delta}(F)}{\log(1/\delta)}\quad (1)$$
>$$\overline\dim_{B}F=\overline\lim\limits_{\delta\to0}\frac{\log N_{\delta}(F)}{\log(1/\delta)}\quad (2)$$
>If those dimensions are equal then we saying that *box-counting dimension* of $F$ is
>$$\dim_{B}F=\lim_{\delta\to0}\frac{\log N_{\delta}}{\log(1/\delta)}\quad(3)$$.^[Kenneth Falconner - "Fractal geometry 2e." p.41-45]

>Often as $N_{\delta}(F)$ we can take the following families of sets:
>- smallest number of closed balls of radius $\delta$ which covers $F$
>- smallest number of cubes with side $\delta$ which covers $F$
>- number of cubes in $\delta$-net of cubes which intersect $F$
>- biggest number of non-intersecting balls with radius $\delta$ and centers in $F$
