>Let $\alpha:I\to\mathbb{R}^{3}$ be a differentiable regular curve with natural parameter $s\in I$. Then the number $|\alpha''(s)|=k(s)$ is said to be the *curvature* of curve $\alpha$ at point $s$.^[Manfredo P. do Carmo - "Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces" p.17]

>Curvature of "straigh line" is zero, and conversely if some curve has curvature equal to zero then it's a straigt line.

>By changing orientation curvature stays the same because
>$$\frac{d\beta}{d(-s)}(-s)=-\frac{d\alpha}{ds}(s)$$
