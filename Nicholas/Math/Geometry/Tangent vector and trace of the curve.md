>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Vector $\alpha'(t)=(x'(t),y'(t),z'(t))\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is called a *tangent vector*(or *vector of speed*) of curve $\alpha$ in point $t$.^[Manfredo P. do Carmo - "Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces" с.2]

>Image $\alpha(I)\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is called a *trace* of a curve $\alpha(t)$. Trace of a curve and curve is a different objects.


>[!example] 
> Let $\alpha(t)=(t^{2},t,t^{3})$ be a parametrized differentiable curve, then its tangent vector will have form $$\alpha'(t)=(2t,1,3t^{2})$$ in point $t$.
