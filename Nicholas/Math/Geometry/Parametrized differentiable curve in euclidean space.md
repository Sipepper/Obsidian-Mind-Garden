>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $\alpha:I\to\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a differentiable mapping of the interval $I=(a,b)$ to euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Then such mapping is said to be a *parametrized differentiable curve*.^[Manfredo P. do Carmo - "Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces" p.2]

>By differentiability we mean that every coordinate function $x_{i}(t)$ is a differentiable function.
