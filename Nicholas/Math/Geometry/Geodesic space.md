>Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, then it's said to be a *geodesic metric space* or just *geodesic space* if every two points in $X$ are joined by a geodesic.^[Martin R. Bridson, Andre Haefliger - "Metric spaces of non-positive curvature" c.4]

>Space $(X,d)$ is *uniquely geodesic* if there is exactly one geodesic joining $x$ to $y$, for all $x,y\in X$.

>[!example] 
>We can view a sphere $S^{2}$ as a metric space, then it's a geodesic space but not uniquely geodesic because every two antipodal point can be connected with infinitely many geodesics.
