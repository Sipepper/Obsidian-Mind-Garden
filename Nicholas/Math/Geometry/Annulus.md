>The map

>is a homeomorphism
>>[!proof]+
>>Consider an open ball $B$ about point $(s,t)$. Then $B$ maps to product of "open circular arc" and open interval, so image of any open set is open, thus such map is open. 
>>
>>And conversely preimage of open circular arc and interval under such map is an open interval, or the union of "half-circles" which are open in quotient topology on $X/\sim$.
