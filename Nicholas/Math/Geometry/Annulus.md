>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Consider topological space $X=[0,1]\times[0,1]\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and the equivalence relation which is generated by
>$$(x,0)\sim(x,1)\quad\forall x\in[0,1]$$
>The quotient topological space $X/\sim$ obtained from the square $X=[0,1]\times[0,1]$ by identifying each point on the upper edge with the corresponding point on the lower edge is called *cylinder* or the *annulus*.

>The map
>$$\begin{matrix}X/\sim&\to &S^{1}\times[0,1]\\ [(s,t)]&\mapsto&(e^{2\pi it},s)\end{matrix}$$
>is a homeomorphism
>>[!proof]+
>>Consider an open ball $B$ about point $(s,t)$. Then $B$ maps to product of "open circular arc" and open interval, so image of any open set is open, thus such map is open. 
>>
>>And conversely preimage of open circular arc and interval under such map is an open interval, or the union of "half-circles" which are open in quotient topology on $X/\sim$.
