>Let $X$ be a metric space. A *comparison triangle in* $\mathbb{E}^{2}$ for a triple of points $(p,q,r)$ in $X$ is a triangle in the Euclidean plane with vertices $\overline{p}$,$\overline{q}$,$\overline{r}$ such that $d(p,q)=d(\overline{p},\overline{q})$, $d(q,r)=d(\overline{q},\overline{r})$ and $d(p,r)=d(\overline{p},\overline{r})$. Such triangle is unique up to isometry, an denoted as $\overline{\Delta}(p,q,r)$.^[Martin R. Bridson, Andre Haefliger - "Metric spaces of non-positive curvature" p.8]

>The interior angle of $\overline{\Delta}(p,q,r)$ at $\overline{p}$ is called the *comparison angle* between $q$ and $r$ and is denoted as $\overline{\angle}_{p}(q,r)$.

>[!example] 
>If we view $S^{2}$ as a metric space we can construct a comparison triangle. The angles *on* a sphere will differ with the angles inside the comparison triangle.
