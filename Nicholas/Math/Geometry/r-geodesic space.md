>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Given $r>0$, a metric space $(X,d)$ is said to be *$r$-geodesic* if for every pair of point $x,y\in X$ with $d(x,y)<r$ there is a geodesic joining $x$ to $y$.^[[[Martin R. Bridson, Andrea Haefliger - Metric spaces of non-positive curvature.pdf#page=23|Martin R. Bridson, Andrea Haefliger - "Metric spaces of non-positive curvature" p.4]]]

>

>Metric space $(X,d)$ is said to be *$r$-uniquely geodesic* if there is a unique geodesic segment joining each such pair of point.

>It's clear that if $(X,d)$ is a geodesic space it also an $r$-geodesic space. But converse is false.
