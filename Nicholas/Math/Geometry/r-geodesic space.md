>Given $r>0$, a metric space $(X,d)$ is said to be *$r$-geodesic* if for every pair of point $x,y\in X$ with $d(x,y)<r$ there is a geodesic joining $x$ to $y$.^[Martin R. Bridson, Andre Haefliger - "Metric spaces of non-positive curvature" c.4]

>Metric space $(X,d)$ is said to be *$r$-uniquely geodesic* if there is a unique geodesic segment joining each such pair of point.

>It's clear that if $(X,d)$ is a geodesic space it also an $r$-geodesic space. But converse is false.
