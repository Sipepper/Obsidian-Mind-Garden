# Proper metric space

>[!dsn]+ Definition
>The metric space $(X,d)$ is said to be *proper* if for every $x\in X$ and every $r>0$, the closed ball $\overline{B}(x,r)$ is compact.^[[[Martin R. Bridson, Andrea Haefliger - Metric spaces of non-positive curvature.pdf#page=+19|Martin R. Bridson, Andrea Haefliger - "Metric spaces of non-positive curvature" p.]]]

>Here $\overline{B}$ is denoting not closure of the ball, but closed ball, i.e. $\overline{B}=\{y:d(x,y)\le r\}$. Sometimes closure of a ball may not be equal to closed ball with the same radius.

>[!example]+
>Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^{n}$ is an example of proper metric space, as every closed ball $\overline{B}$ is exactly equal to closure of open ball $B$.
