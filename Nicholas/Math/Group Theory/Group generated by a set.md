>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $G$ be a group and $S$ a subset of $G$. We say that $S$ *generates* $G$, or that $S$ is a set of *generators* for $G$, if every element of $G$ can be expressed as a product of elements of $S$ or inverses of elements of $S$.

>Set of all such product  is a subgroup of $G$, and is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $S$.

>We say that $S$ generates $G$ if and only if the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $S$ is $G$ itself. If $G$ is generated by $S$, then we write $G=\langle S\rangle$.^[Serge Lang - "Algebra" p.9]

>Given elements $x_{1},\dots,x_{n}\in G$, these elements generate a subgroup $\langle x_{1},\dots,x_{n}\rangle$, namely the set of all elements of $G$ of the form
>$$x_{i_{1}}^{k_{1}}\dots x_{i_{r}}^{k_{r}\quad}k_{1},\dots,k_{r}\in\mathbb{Z}$$ 

>[!example]+ 
>We can consider the *group of symmetries of the square* (special case of [[Dihedral group]]), generated by two elements $\sigma$ (rotation) and $\tau$ (reflection) such that
>$$\sigma^{4}=\tau^{2}=e\quad\text{and}\quad\tau\sigma\tau^{-1}=\sigma^{3}$$

>[!example]+
>The [[Quaternion group]] is generated by two elements, $i,j$ such that if we put $k=ij$ and $m=i^{2}$, then
>$$i^{4}=j^{4}=k^{4}=e,\quad i^{2}=j^{2}=k^{2}=m,\quad ij=mji$$
