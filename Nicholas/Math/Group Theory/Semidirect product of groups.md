>Let $G$ be a group and let $H\le G$ and $N\trianglelefteq G$. We say that $G$ is a *semidirect product* of $H$ and $N$ if $G=NH$ and $H\cap N=\{e\}$.^[Serge Lang - "Algebra" p.76]

>Conversely, let $N,H$ be groups, and let $\psi:H\to\text{Aut}(N)$ be a given homomorphism. Construct a semidirect product as follows. Let $G$ be the set of pairs $(x,h)$ with $x\in N$ and $h\in H$. Define the composition law
>$$(x_{1},h_{1})(x_{2},h_{2})=(x_{1}^{\psi(h_{1})x_{2}},h_{1}h_{2})$$
>then such group yields a semidirect product of $N$ and $H$, identifying $N$ with the set of elements $(x,1)$ and $H$ with the set of elements $(1,h)$.
