>Any connect locally compact group is compactly generated.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=522|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.522]]]

>[!proof]+
>Let $K$ be any compact neighborhood of $e$. Then by [[connected topological group is generated by any neighbourhood of neutral element]], $G=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}K^{n}$; that is, $G$ is compactly generated.
