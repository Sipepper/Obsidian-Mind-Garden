>Let $G$ be a topological group and $H$ be a locally closed subgroup. Then $H$ is a closed subgroup.^[Alain M. Robert - "A course in p-adic analysis" p.20]

>[!proof]
>Let $H$ be a locally closed subgroup of $G$, then $H$ is open in it's closure $\overline{H}$. But such closure is also a subgroup of $G$. Therefore from [[Closure of certain subgroups in topological groups]] and [[Clopen topological subgroup]] we see that $H$ is a closed in it's closure(i.e. $H=\overline{H}$) and thus is closed in $G$.
