>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a *characteristic subgroup* if for every automorphism $\phi$ of $G$, one has $\phi(H)\leqslant H$, denoted as $H\;\textbf{char}\;G$.

>Stronger condition, $\phi(H)=H$ for every automorphism $\phi$ of $G$, is equivalent to condition defined above, because $\phi^{-1}(H)\leqslant H$ implies the reverse inclusion $H\leqslant\phi(H)$.

#### Properties
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $H$ be a characteristic automorphism of $G$. Then every automorphism of $G$ induces an automorphism of the quotient group $G/H$, which yields a homomorphism $$\textbf{Aut}(G)\to\textbf{Aut}(G/H)$$

>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>If $G$ has a unique subgroup of a given index, then $H$ is characteristic in $G$.
