>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $G$ be a group, and $[G,G]$ is the commutator subgroup of $G$, then by iterating, i.e. taking commutator subgroup of commutator subgroup
>$$\begin{align}G^{(0)}&:=G\\G^{(n)}&:=[G^{(n-1)},G^{(n-1)}] \end{align}\quad n\in \mathbb{N}$$
>The groups $G^{(2)},G^{(3)},\dots$ are called the *second derived subgroup*, *third derived subgroup*, and so forth. The descending normal series
>$$\dots\triangleleft G^{(2)}\triangleleft G^{(1)}\triangleleft G^{(0)}=G$$
>is called the *derived series*.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator_subgroup#Derived_series]

>It should not be confused with the lower central series, whose terms are $G_{n}:=[G_{n-1},G]$.
