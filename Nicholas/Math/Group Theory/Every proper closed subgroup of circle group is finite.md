>Every proper closed subgroup of $\mathbb{T}$ is finite.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=539|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.539]]]

>[!proof]+
>Identify $\mathbb{T}$ with the quotient group $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ and let $p:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ be the canonical quotient homomorphism. If $G$ is any proper closed subgroup of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ then $p^{-1}(G)$ is a proper closed subgroup of $\mathbb{R}$. So $p^{-1}(G)$ is discrete. By [[quotient topology on a quotient group]], the restriction $p|_{p^{-1}(G)}:p^{-1}(G)\to G$ is an open map, so we see that $G$ is discrete. As $G$ is also compact, it is finite.
