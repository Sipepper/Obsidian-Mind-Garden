>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of a group $G$ and $G/N$ be the set of all left(right) cosets of $N$ in $G$. Because cosets don't depend on choose of representatives we can define composition law on this set, as follows
>$$(aN)(bN)=(aN)(Nb)=a(NN)b=a(Nb)=(ab)N$$
>we see that normatily is a crucial condition for subgroup $N$. Such group is said to be the *quotient group* of $G$ by $N$.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_group]

>[!example] 
>Consider the group with addition modulo $6$: $G=\set{0,1,2,3,4,5}$. Consider the subgroup $N=\set{0,3}$, which is normal because $G$ is abelian. Then the set of (left) cosets is of size three:
>$$G/N=\set{a+N:a\in G}=\set{\{0,3\},\{1,4\},\{2,5\}}=\set{0+N,1+N,2+N}$$
>Then the set $G/N$ with operation on cosets is a quotient group isomorphic to the cyclic group of order $3$.
