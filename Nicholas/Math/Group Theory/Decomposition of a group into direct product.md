>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $G$ be a group, $H\le G$ and $K\le G$, i.e. $H$ and $K$ are normal subgroups of $G$. Also let $H\cap K=I$, $H\cup K=G$, where $I$ is a trivial subgroup, then
>$$G\cong H\times K$$

In such way we can decompose any group with conditions above into a direct product
$$G\cong\prod_{i\in I}H_{i}$$

>[!example] 
>Let $n$ be an odd integer, and let $D_{4n}$ be the dihedral group of order $4n$:
>$$D_{4n}=\langle r,s|r^{2n}=s^{2}=1,sr=r^{-1}s\rangle$$
>Then $D_{4n}$ is the direct product of the subgroup $\langle r^{2},s\rangle$(which is isomorphic to $D_{2n}$) and the two-element subgroup $\set{1,r^{n}}$.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_product_of_groups]
