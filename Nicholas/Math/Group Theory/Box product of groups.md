>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $G_{\alpha}$, bo some family of groups with indexing set $I$ of arbitrary cardinality. Then the group $G$ called the *box product* of groups denoted as
>$$G=\overline{\prod_{\alpha\in I}} G_{\alpha}$$
>defined as the set of functions
>$$f:I\to\bigcup_{\alpha\in I}G_{\alpha}$$
>such that $f(\alpha)\in G_{\alpha}$, $\forall \alpha\in I$. Together with law of composition defined as
>$$(fg)(\alpha)=f(\alpha)g(\alpha)$$
>is a group.

>The value of function $f$ in $\alpha$ is said to be a *projection* of $f$.
