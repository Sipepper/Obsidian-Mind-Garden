>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Torsion group $P$ is said to be a $p$-*group*, if all it's elements, different from neutral, have order equal to some power of prime $p$.

>[!example]+ 
>Cyclic group $C_{p^n}$ is a $p$-group. Because order of every element must divide the order of the group, thus every element has order of some power of $p$.
