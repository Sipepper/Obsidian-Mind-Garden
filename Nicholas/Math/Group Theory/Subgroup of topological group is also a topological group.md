>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Let $G$ be a topological group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. With its subspace topology, $H$ is a topological group.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.519]

>[!proof]+
>The mapping $(x,y)\mapsto xy$ of $H\times H$ onto $H$ and the mapping $x\mapsto x^{-1}$ of $H$ onto $H$ are continuous since they are restrictions of the corresponding mappings of $G\times G$ and $G$.

>- $\mathbb{Z}\le\mathbb{R}$
>- $\mathbb{Q}\le\mathbb{R}$
