>[!proof]+
>$\Rightarrow$
>Let $\text{gp}\{a_{1},\dots,a_{p},b\}$ be a discrete subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ of rank $p$, that is $\dim\text{gp}\{a_{1},\dots,a_{p},b\}=p$, then by [[discrete subgroup of euclidean space contained in sp_Q of it's generators]] every point in $\text{gp}\{a_{1},\dots,a_{p}\}$ is a linear combination of $a_{1},\dots,a_{p}$ with rational coefficients, then all $t_{i}$ in definition of $b$ must be rational, as $G\subseteq\text{sp}_{\mathbb{Q}}\{a_{1},\dots,a_{p}\}$.
>
>$\Leftarrow$
>Let $t_{1},\dots,t_{p}$ all be rational numbers. Then every element of $\text{gp}\{a_{1},\dots,a_{p},b\}$ is of the form
>$$\begin{align}m_{1}a_{1}+\dots+m_{p}a_{p}+kb&=\sum\limits\limits_{i=1}^{p}m_{i}a_{i}+k\sum\limits_{i=1}^{p}t_{i}a_{i}\\ &=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{p}(m_{i}+kt_{i})a_{i} \end{align}$$
>where all coefficients $m_{i}+kt_{i}$ are always rational.
>Consider a point $x\in\text{gp}\{a_{1},\dots,a_{p},b\}$ and an open $\varepsilon$-ball $B_{\varepsilon}(x)$ centered at $x$. Then the distance from another arbitrary point $y\in\text{gp}\{a_{1},\dots,a_{p},b\}$ to $x$ is 
>$$\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{p}(m_{i}+kt_{i}-n_{i}-lt_{i})^2}$$
>as every $t_{i}$ is a rational number, every $m_{i}+kt_{i}-n_{i}-lt_{i}$(at least one must be non-zero) has a minimal rational absolute value $d_{i}$. Then, we can always find a real number $\varepsilon$ such that
>$$\varepsilon<\sqrt{d_{1}^{2}+\dots+d_{p}^{2}}$$
>so $x$ is an isolated point. As $x$ was chosen randomly $\text{gp}\{a_{1},\dots,a_{p},b\}$ is a discrete group.
