>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A topological group $G$ is said to be *compactly generated* if there exists a compact subset $X$ of $G$ such that $G$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $X$.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=522|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.522]]]

>[!example]+ 
>- $\mathbb{R}$ is compactly generated by $[0,1]$ (or any other non-trivial compact interval).
>- Any compact group is compactly generated.
