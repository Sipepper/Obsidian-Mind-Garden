>[!dsn]+ Theorem
>Let $X$ and $G$ be finite, and consider a $G$-action on $X$. If $A\subset X$ is a subset which intersects each orbit in exactly one point, we have
>$$\# X=\sum\limits_{x\in A}\frac{\# G}{\#G_{x}}$$
>.^[[[Marcel Berger - Geometry 1.pdf#page=22 |Marcel Berger - "Geometry 1" p.10]]]

>The set $A$ is called a *section* of the map $p:X\to X/G$ because it is the image $s(X/G)$ of a section $s:X/G\to X$ of $p$, i.e., a map such that $p\circ s=\text{Id}_{X/G}$. We can say that $A$ parametrizes the orbits.

>[!proof]+
>It's a corollary of [[stabilizer subgroup]], [[orbit in homogeneous space]] and proof of [[if group acting on homogeneous space is finite then this space is also finite]]

>That is, set $X$ can be partitioned into family of orbits.
