>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>A set $\text{GL}(n,K)$ of invertible $n\times n$ matrices over a field $K$ has a group structure under operation of matrix multiplication and said to be the *general linear group* of order $n$ over a field $K$.

>When $n\ge 2$ $\text{GL}(n,K)$ is *not* abelian.

#### Important subgroups
>[!example]+ 
>- $\text{D}(n,K)$ is a group of diagonal matrices called *diagonal group*.
>- $\text{UT}(n,K)$ is a group of upper(lower) triangular matrices with ones on main diagonal called *unitriangular group*.
>- $\text{T}(n,K)$ is a group of upper(lower) triangular matrices called *triangular group*.
>- $\text{SL}(n,K)$ is a group of matrices with $\det=1$ called *special linear group*.
>- $O(n,K)$ is a group defined as
>  $$O(n,K)=\set{Q\in\text{GL}(n,K):Q^{T}Q=QQ^{T}=I}$$
>  called *orthogonal group*.
