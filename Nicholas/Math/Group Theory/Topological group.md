>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $(G,\tau)$ be a set $G$ that is a group with a topology $\tau$ on $G$. Then $(G,\tau)$ is said to be a *topological group* if
>- the mapping $(x,y)\mapsto xy$ of the product space $(G,\tau)\times(G,\tau)$ onto $(G,\tau)$ is continuous, and
>- the mapping $x\mapsto x^{-1}$ of $(G,\tau)$ onto $(G,\tau)$ is continuous.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=512|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.512]]]

>[!example]+ 
>The additive group of real numbers with the euclidean topology is a topological group, usually denoted by $\mathbb{R}$.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.513]]]

>Set of all $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is also a topological group. With respect to $p$-adic metric.^[[[Alain M. Robert - A course in p-adic analysis.pdf#page=34 |Alain M. Robert - "A course in p-adic analysis" p.18]]]

>Of course not every topology on a group makes it into a topological group. If a topology $\tau$ on a group $G$ makes $(G,\tau)$ into a topological group, then $\tau$ is said to be a *group topology*.
