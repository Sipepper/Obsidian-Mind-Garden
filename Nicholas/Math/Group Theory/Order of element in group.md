>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Let $G$ be a group, then smallest $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $a^{n}=e$ is said to be the *order* of element $a\in G$. 

>[!example]+ 
>- Let $D_{n}$ be a dihedral group, then element $d$ which represents the "reflection" has an order $2$, when $r$, element which describe rotation, has an order $n$.
>- Let $\mathbb{Z}$ be the set of integers under operation of addition, then every element, except neutral, has an infinite order.
