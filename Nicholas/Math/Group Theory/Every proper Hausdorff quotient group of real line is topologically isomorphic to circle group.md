>Every proper Hausdorff quotient group of $\mathbb{R}$ is topologically isomorphic to $\mathbb{T}$.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=538|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.538]]]

>[!proof]+
>If $\mathbb{R}/G$ is a proper Hausdorff quotient group of $\mathbb{R}$, then, by [[quotient topological group is discrete if quotient is open]], $G$ is a closed subgroup of $\mathbb{R}$. By [[closed subgroup of real line]], $G$ is of the form $a\mathbb{Z}$, $a>0$. Noting that the map $x\mapsto\frac{1}{a}x$ is a topological group isomorphism of $\mathbb{R}$ onto itself such that $a\mathbb{Z}$ maps to $\mathbb{Z}$, we see that $\mathbb{R}/a\mathbb{Z}$ is topologically isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ which, we know, is topologically isomorphic to $\mathbb{T}$.
