# Simply transitive group action on a set

>[!dsn]+ Definition
>The action $(G,X)$ is called *simply transitive* if for every $x,y\in X$ there exists a unique $g\in G$ such that $g(x)=y$.^[[[Marcel Berger - Geometry 1.pdf#page=19 |Marcel Berger - "Geometry 1" p.7]]]

>[!example]+ 
>If $G$ is an abelian group, any faithful transitive action is simply transitive.
>>[!proof]+
>>If for some $x\in X$ and $g,h\in G$ we have $g(x)=h(x)$, then $g(y)=h(y)$ for any $y\in G$, since
>>$$g(y)=g(k(x))=k(g(x))=k(h(x))=h(k(x))=h(y)$$

>[!example]+ 
>Left(right) translations are simply transitive.
