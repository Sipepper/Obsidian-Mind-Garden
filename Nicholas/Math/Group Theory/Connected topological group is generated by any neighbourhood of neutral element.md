>Let $U$ be any neighbourhood of $e$ in a connected topological group $G$. Then $G=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}U^{n}$; that is, any connected group is generated by any neighbourhood of $e$.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.522]

>[!proof]+
>Let $V$ be a symmetric neighbourhood of $e$ such that $V\subseteq U$. By [[Union of symmetric neighbourhoods in topological group is a subgroup]], $H=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}V^{n}$ is an open and closed subgroup of $G$. As $G$ is connected, $H=G$; that is $G=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}V^{n}$. 
>As $V\subseteq U$, $V^{n}\subseteq U^{n}$, for each $n$ and so $G=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}U^{n}$, as required.
