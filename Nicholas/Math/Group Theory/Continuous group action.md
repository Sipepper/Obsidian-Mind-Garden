>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Let $X$ be a topological space and $G$ be a group acting on it. We say that action is *continuous*, if for every $g\in G$ the map
>$$\begin{align}X&\to X\\ x&\mapsto g\cdot x \end{align}$$
>is continuous.^[[[Stefan Friedl - Algebraic topology.pdf#page=186|Stefan Friedl - "Algebraic topology" p.186 ]]]

>If the action is continuos then it's also a homeomorhism, as $x\mapsto g^{-1}\cdot x$ is a continuous inverse map to $x\mapsto g\cdot x$.

>[!example]+ 
>The action of $G=\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ on $X=\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by addition is free and continuous but it's not transitive.
