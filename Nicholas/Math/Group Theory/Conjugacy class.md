>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $G$ be a group, because conjugation in groups is a equivalence relation, we can partition our group to *conjugacy classes* $a^G$ where $a\in G$.

>Unlike cosets, conjugacy classes can have different cardinality.

>In particular, subgroup $H$ is normal if it's consists of several complete conjugacy classes.
>>[!proof]+
>>Suppose that $H=\bigcup a^{G}$, then, as conjugacy classes are disjoint, then
>>$$gHg^{-1}=\bigcup ga^{G}g^{-1}=\bigcup a^{G}=H$$
>>Thus $H$ is indeed a normal subgroup.
