>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $G$ be a group, because conjugation in groups is a equivalence relation, we can partition our group to *conjugacy classes* $a^G$ where $a\in G$.

>Unlike cosets, conjugacy classes can have different cardinality.

>In particular, subgroup $H$ is normal if it's consists of several complete conjugacy classes.
