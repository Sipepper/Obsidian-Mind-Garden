>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $G$ be a topological group, if $G$ has the discrete topology it's said to be *discrete group*.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_group]

>That is, $G$ is discrete if there is no limit points in it. And equivalently $G$ is discrete if and only if its identity is isolated.
>>[!proof]+
>>As [[topological group translations are homeomorphisms]] if $\{e\}$ is isolated, so is every other element, so by definition of isolated point and discrete topology, $G$ indeed has discrete topology, so it's a discrete group.

>A subgroup $H$ of a topological group $G$ is a *discrete subgroup* if $H$ is discrete when endowed with the subspace topology from $G$.
>
>In other words there is a neighborhood of the identity in $G$ containing no other element of $H$.

>[!example]+ 
>For example the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ form a discrete subgroup of the reals $\mathbb{R}$ with standard euclidean topology, but the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$, do not.
