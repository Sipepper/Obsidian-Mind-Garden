>If $G$ is a topological group and $N$ is a compact normal subgroup of $G$ then the canonical homomorphism $p:G\to G/N$ is a closed map. The homomorphism $p$ is also an open map.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.524]

>[!proof]+
>If $S$ is a closed subset of $G$, then $p^{-1}(p(S))=NS$ which is the product in $G$ of a compact set and a closed set. By [[Mutliplication of different subsets of topological groups]] then, this product is a closed set. So $p(S)$ is closed in $G/N$ and $p$ is a closed map. As $p$ is a quotient mapping, [[Quotient topology on a quotient group]]  implies that it is an open map.
