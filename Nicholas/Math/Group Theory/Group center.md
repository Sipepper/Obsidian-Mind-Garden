>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $G$ be a group, then the *center* of $G$, denoted $Z(G)$, is the set of elements $g$ which satisfy the following equivalent conditions
>1. $xgx^{-1}=g,\forall x\in G$, i.e. elements which is fixed under conjugation.
>2. $C_{G}(g)=G$, i.e. centralizer of each such element equals to whole group $G$.
>3. Conjugacy class of $g$ in $G$ is the singleton set $\set{g}$.
>
>If center is a trivial subgroup, then it's often said that $G$ has *trivial center*, or *has no center*.^[https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Center]

>Group $G$ is abelian if and only if $G=Z(G)$.

>Every subgroup of $Z(G)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
