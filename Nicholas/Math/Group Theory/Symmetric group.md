>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $M$ be some set, then by $\textbf{S}(M)$ we denote the family of all bijections from $M$ to itself. If we take function composition as an operation on such set, then $\textbf{S}(M)$ will be a group. Such group is called the *symmetric group* of set $M$.

>If set $M$ is finite, or $M=\set{1,\dots,n}$ then such group called the *permutation group* on $n$ elements and denoted as $S_n$.

>$|S_n|=n!$ and when $n>2$ the group $S_n$ is not abelian.

>[!example]+ 
>$S_3$ (which is isomorphic to a dihedral group $D_{6}$) is an symmetric group, which describes the symmetries of the equilateral triangle.
