>The action $(G,X,\Phi)$ is called *faithful* if $\Phi$ is injective, that is only $e\in G$ maps to the identity $\text{Id}_{X}$.^[Marcel Berger - "Geometry 1" p.6]

>[!example]+ 
>Consider the action $(\mathbb{Z},T,\Phi)$, where $T$ is a set of three distinct points which forms a triangle centered symmetrically around the origin of complex plane and $\Phi(g)(z)=z\cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{3} g}$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$ action. Then $G$ is *not* faithful as $\Phi(3)(T)=\Phi(0)(T)$, but if we consider the quotient $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$, then action $(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z},T,\overline{\Phi})$ is faithful as only $\overline{\Phi}(\mathbb{Z})=e$.

>>It is precisely a rotational subgroup of a dihedral group $D_{3}$, i.e. symmetry group of a triangle.
