# Conjugation in groups

>[!dsn]+ Definition 
>Let $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are subsets of group $G$. Then those sets are called *conjugate* to each other if there exist element $g\in G$ such that 
>$$S_{1}^{g}=gS_{1}g^{-1}=S_{2}$$
>those sets can be singletons or subgroups.
>
>Conjugation of one set by another often denoted as $A^{B}$, where $A,B\subset G$.

>In particular normal subgroup is just a group which is invariant to all conjugations:
>$$H^{G}=g^{-1}Hg=H,\quad\forall g\in G$$
