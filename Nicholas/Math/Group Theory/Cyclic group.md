>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>If the group is generated by only one elements,i.e. $(a)=\set{a^{n}:n\in\mathbb{Z}}$, then it called a *cyclic* group. 

>[!example] 
>The set of all roots of equation $x^{n}=1$ under regular multiplication is a finite cyclic group.

>Every cyclic group is either isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$ or to group $\mathbb{Z}(n)$ the additive group of residue ring.

#### Properties of cyclic groups
1. Every subgroup of a cyclic group is a cyclic group.

   >
2. Infinite cyclic group has exactly two generators $a$ and $a^{-1}$

3. Let $G$ be a finite cyclic group of order $n$ and $x$ is a generator of $G$. The set of all generators of group $G$ is consists of all powers $x^{\nu}$ of $x$ exponent of which is relatively prime to $n$.

4. Let $G$ be a cyclic group and $a,b$ be it's two generators. Then exist an automorphism of $G$ such that $a\mapsto b$. Converse, every automorphism of $G$ maps $a$ to some generator of $G$, i.e. under automorphisms generators goes to generators.
