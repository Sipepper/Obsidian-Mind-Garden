>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $p$ be a prime number. The set $\mathbb{C}(p^{\infty})$ of all solutions of the equation $x^{p^{n}}=1$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, on complex plane with default multiplication is an infinite $p$-group. This group is called the *$p$-quasicyclic group* or *Prufer group*.

>Also $p$-quasicyclic group can be constructed as quotient group $\mathbb{Q}(p)/\mathbb{Z}$ of $p$-adic fractions by the integers with default addition.
