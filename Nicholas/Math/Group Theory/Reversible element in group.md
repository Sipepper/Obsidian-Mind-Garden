>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $G$ be a group, and $a\in G$. If there exists some $b\in G$ such that
>$$a^{b}=bab^{-1}=a^{-1}$$
>then $a$ is said to be *reversible* in $G$.^[[[Anthony G. O'Farrel, Ian Short - "Reversibility in the diffeomorphism group of the real line".pdf#page=1|Anthony G. O'Farrel, Ian Short - "Reversibility in the diffeomorphism group of the real line" p.1]]]

>We say that such *element* is *reversed* by it's conjugator.
