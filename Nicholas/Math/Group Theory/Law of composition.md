>Let $S$ be some set. The mapping $$(\cdot):S\times S\to S$$ is called a *law of composition* on $S$. If $y,x\in S$, then the image of pair $(x,y)$ under such mapping is called a *multiplication* with the respect to law of composition. If law is commutative then people often use the additive notation $x+y$.^[С.Лэнг - "Алгебра" с.17]

>Let $S$ be a set and the $(\cdot)$ be a law of composition. If the following condition holds $$(xy)z=x(yz),\quad\forall x,y,z\in S$$ then the law of composition is called *associative*.

>Element $e\in S$, such that $ex=x=xe$ for all $x\in S$ is called a *unitary element*(neutral element). In additive case we call this element a *zero* element. Unitary element is unique because $$e=ee'=e'$$
