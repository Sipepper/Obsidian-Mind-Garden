>[!dsn]+ Proposition
>If $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ then $\text{gp}\{a,b\}$, the subgroup of $\mathbb{R}$ generated by $\{a,b\}$, is closed if and only if $a$ and $b$ are rationally dependent.

>[!proof]+
>$\Rightarrow$
>Suppose $\text{gp}\{a,b\}$ is closed, then by [[closed subgroup of real line]] it's either $\mathbb{R}$, $\{0\}$ or $\text{gp}(a,b)$ is discrete and of the form $c\mathbb{Z}$. 
>If $\text{gp}\{a,b\}$ is of the form $c\mathbb{Z}$, then
>$$a=nc\quad b=mc$$
>and
>$$\frac{a}{n}=\frac{b}{m}\Rightarrow am=bn$$
>thus $a$ and $b$ are rationally dependent.
>***
>As $\text{gp}\{a,b\}$ is countable, it cannot be equal to $\mathbb{R}$.
>
>If $\text{gp}\{a,b\}=\{0\}$, then there exist integers $k,l$ such that $ka+lb=0$, therefore
>$$ka=-lb$$
>so $a,b$ are rationally dependent.
>***
>
>$\Leftarrow$
>Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are rationally dependent, that is there exists integers $n,m$ such that 
>$$na=mb\Rightarrow b=\frac{n}{m}a$$
>Thus the subgroup 
>$$\begin{align}\text{gp}\{a,b\}&=\left\{pa+qb:p,q\in\mathbb{Z} \right\}\\ &=\left\{pa+ q\frac{n}{m}a:p,q\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}\\ &=\left\{\frac{1}{m}(pm+qn)a:p,q\in\mathbb{Z} \right\}\\ &=\frac{a}{m}\mathbb{Z} \end{align}$$
>is closed by [[closed subgroup of real line]].

>[!example]+ 
>$\text{gp}\{1,\sqrt{2}\}$ and $\text{gp}\{\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}\}$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$.
