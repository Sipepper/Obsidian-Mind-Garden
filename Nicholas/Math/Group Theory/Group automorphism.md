>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $G$ be a group, then the group isomorphism $f:G\to G$ is called an *isomorphism*.

>Equivalently group endomorphism is an automorphism if it's a bijective map.

>All automorphisms of $G$ form a group $\textbf{Aut}(G)$ under operation of composition.

>[!example] 
>Let $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ be a finite cyclic group of order $p$, then the mapping $f(x)=nx$ where $n$ is relatively prime to $p$ is an automorphism for any such $p$.^[https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GroupAutomorphism.html]
