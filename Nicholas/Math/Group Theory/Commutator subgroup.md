# Commutator subgroup

>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A subgroup $\langle [G,G]\rangle$ generated by all commutators is called the *commutator subgroup*(*derived subgroup*) denoted as $G'$ or $G^{(1)}$.

>Group $G$ is abelian if and only if it's derived subgroup is trivial.

>In some sense derived subgroup measures deviation from commutativity.

>Since 
>$$\left([g_{1},h_{1}]\dots[g_{n},h_{n}]\right)^{s}=[g_{1}^{s},h_{1}^{s}]\dots[g_{n}^{s},h_{n}^{s}]$$
>the commutator subgroup is normal in $G$.
