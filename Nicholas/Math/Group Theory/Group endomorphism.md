>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $G$ be a group, then a homomorphism $g:G\to G$ is called *endomorphism*
 of $G$.

>[!example] 
>Let $\mathbb{Z}$ be an additive group of integers. We can define the endomorphism $f$ as follows
>$a\mapsto2a$
>it's clear that this is a homomorphism, but such mapping is not bijective thus we have an endomorphism.
