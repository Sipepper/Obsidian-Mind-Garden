>If $\{a_{1},\dots,a_{m}\}$ is a linearly independent subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then $\text{gp}\{a_{1},\dots,a_{m}\}$ is topologically isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{m}$.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.539]

>[!proof]+
>Choose elements $a_{m+1},\dots,a_{n}$ so that $\{a_{1},\dots,a_{m},a_{m+1},\dots,a_{n}\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. It is clear that if $\{c_{1},\dots,c_{n}\}$ is the canonical basis for $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then $\text{gp}\{c_{1},\dots,c_{m}\}$ is topologically isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{m}$. By [[Every linear transformation of euclidean space onto itself is a homeomorphism]], the linear map taking $a_{i}$ to $c_{i}$, $i=1,\dots,n$, yields a topological group isomorphism of $\text{gp}\{a_{1},\dots,a_{m}\}$ onto $\text{gp}\{c_{1},\dots,c_{m}\}=\mathbb{Z}^{m}$.
