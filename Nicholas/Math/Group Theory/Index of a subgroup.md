>By one-to-one correspondence $gH\leftrightarrow Hg^{-1}$ we can deduce that the families of left and right cosets have the same cardinality. Therefore the cardinality of the family of cosets is called an *index* of a subgroup $H$ in group $G$. Denoted as $|G:H|$.

>Every coset $gH$, $Hg$ has the same cardinality as the original group. Because we can build a bijections $h\leftrightarrow gh$, $h\leftrightarrow hg$,$\forall h\in H$.


>[!example]
>Let $G=\mathbb{Z}$ and $H=3\mathbb{Z}$, then the index of $H$ in $G$ will be equal to $3$, because there are only three cosets $0+3\mathbb{Z}$, $1+3\mathbb{Z}$, $2+3\mathbb{Z}$.
