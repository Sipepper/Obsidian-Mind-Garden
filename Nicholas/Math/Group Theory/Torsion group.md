>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $G$ be a group, if orders of all it's elements are finite, then such group is called to be *torsion group*(*periodic group*).

>If orders of elements is bounded by some value, then such value is called *period* of group $G$.

>[!example]+ 
>The dihedral group is an example of a torsion group.
