>Let $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ be a euclidean space, and let $A_{1},\dots,A_{n}$ be a set of points some of which are connected with non intersecting lines. Then such set endowed with subspace topology from $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is called a *graph*, or *$1$-dimensional complex*.^[В.В. Прасолов "Элементы комбинаторной и дифференциальной топологии" с.17]


>Points $A_{1},\dots,A_{n}$ are called *vertices*, or *$0$-dimensional cells*.

>A graph can contain *loops* and *double edges*.

>Number of edges which come out of vertex are called a *degree* of that vertex.

>Sequence of pairwise different vertices $v_{1},\dots,v_{n}$ connected with edges $v_{1}v_{2},v_{2}v_{3},\dots,v_{n}v_{1}$ is called a *cycle*.
