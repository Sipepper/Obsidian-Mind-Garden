>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $A$ be a finite-dimensional algebra over a field $F$. Then we can describe any multiplication in $A$ by defining multiplication of basis vectors
>$$e_{i}e_{j}=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}\gamma_{i,j,k}e_{k}=\gamma_{i,j,k}e_{k}\quad\gamma_{i,j,k}\in F$$
>Elements $\gamma_{i,j,k}$ is said to be a *structure constants* of algebra $A$ with respect to basis $e_{i}$

>Any multiplication can be described by structure constants
>>[!proof]+
>>Indeed, let $x,y\in A$ then
>>$$x=\sum\limits_{i}\lambda_{i}e_{i}\qquad y=\sum\limits_{j}\mu_{j}e_{j}$$
>>Then
>>$$xy=\left(\sum\limits_{i}\lambda_{i}e_{i} \right)\left(\sum\limits_{j}\mu_{j}e_{j}\right)=\sum\limits_{i,j}(\lambda_{i}e_{i})(\mu_{j}e_{j})=\sum\limits_{i,j}(\lambda_{i}\mu_{j})(e_{i}e_{j})$$
>>therefore multiplication of any two elements is defined by $e_{i},e_{j}$ which is defined by structure constants.

>Algebra $A$ is said to be *commutative*, if multiplication is commutative, i.e. $ab=ba$ for all elements $a,b\in A$.

>Algebra $A$ is said to be *associative* if multiplication is associative
>$$(ab)c=a(bc)$$
