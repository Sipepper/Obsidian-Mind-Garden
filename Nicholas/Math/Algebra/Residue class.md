>[!dsn]+ Definition
>As congruence of integers is an equivalence relation, we can define a set
>$$[a]_{n}=\{b\in\mathbb{Z}:a\equiv b\mod{n}\}$$
>which is said to be the *residue class* of $a$ modulo $n$.
>In another words, $[a]_{n}$ contains all integers which are congruent to $a$ modulo $n$. 

>[!example]+ 
>Let  $a=0$, then $[0]_{n}$ contains all numbers which are divisible by $n$.
