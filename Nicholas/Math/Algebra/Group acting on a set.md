>[!dsn] Direct strict note
> Let $S$ be a set and $G$ is a group. Mapping $G\times S\to S$, denoted as $xs$ as image of pair $(x,s)$, such that $\forall x,y\in G$ and $s\in S$ following properties holds $$(xy)s=x(ys)\quad\text{and}\quad es=s$$ is called a *left group action*.^[С. Ленг Алгебра с.32-33]

>When group $G$ acting on a set $S$, the set $S$ is often called a *$G$-set*.
