>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Consider a subset $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ of complex plane defined as
>$$\mathbb{Z}[i]:=\{a+bi:a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\}$$
>Then it is closed under addition and multiplication and called the *Gaussian integers*.^[[Lectures at KAU - Yevgen Polulyakh](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OBF4iFXhiyJQ2lVaDTRnDEnyDf6hImIg)]

>$\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a subring of $\mathbb{C}$, as $1_{\mathbb{C}}=1+0i$.
