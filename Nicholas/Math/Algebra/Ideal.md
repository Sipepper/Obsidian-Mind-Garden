>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $I$ be some subspace of lie algebra $L$. If $[a,b]\in I$ for all $a\in L$ and $b\in I$ then $I$ is said to be the *ideal* in algebra $L$. In another words $I$ is ideal of $L$ if
>$$[L,I]\subseteq I$$
>by anticommutativity ($[a,b]=-[b,a]$) we have that
>$$[L,I]=[I,L]$$
>Ideals are denoted as $I\triangleleft L$. Algebra always has the $<0>$ and $L$ ideals. 

>Ideal is always a subalgebra
>>[!proof]
>>Let $I\triangleleft L$. Then
>>$$[I,I]\subseteq[L,I]\subseteq I$$
>>therefore $[I,I]\subseteq I$, and thus $I$ is a subalgebra of $L$. But the converse is *false* not all subalgebras are ideals.

#### Ideals in Leibniz algebras
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>The subspace $I$ of a Leibniz algebra $L$ is said to be *left ideal* of $L$, if $[a,b]\in I$ for all $a\in L$,$b\in I$, i.e. subspace $I$ of $L$ is a left ideal of $L$ if
>$$[L,I]\subseteq I$$

>Similarly a subspace $U$ of $L$ is said to be the *right ideal* of $L$ if $[b,a]\in U$ for all $a\in L$, $b\in U$, or
>$$[U,L]\subseteq U$$

>If the subspace $V$ is both right and left ideal of $L$, then we just saying that $V$ is an *ideal* of $L$, equivalently
>$$[L,V],[V,L]\subseteq V$$
>Often denoted as $V\triangleleft L$.

>Every ideal(left, right or both) is a subalgebra.
>$$[I,I]\subseteq[L,I]\subseteq I$$
>$$[I,I]\subseteq[I,L]\subseteq I$$
>But not all subalgebras are ideals.
