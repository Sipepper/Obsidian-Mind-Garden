#### Of a ring
>[!dsn]+ Definition
>The *characteristic* of a ring $R$ is either
>- smallest positive integer $n$, such that $n\cdot 1_{R}=0_{R}$,
>- $0$, if $n\cdot 1_{R}\ne 0_{R}$, $\forall n>0$.^[[Lectures at KAU - Eugene Polulyakh](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OBF4iFXhiyJQ2lVaDTRnDEnyDf6hImIg)]

>[!example]+
>Let $M_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ be a [[Ring of matrices]] with multiplicative identity $I$ (diagonal matrix with $1$ on main diagonal), then $\operatorname{char} M_{n}(\mathbb{R})=0$, as $n\cdot I\ne0$, for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
 
#### Of a field
>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>The *characteristic* of a field $F$ is the order of $1$, i.e. neutral element from multiplicative group in additive group.
>>It's the smallest positive integer $m$ such that the sum $1+\dots+1$ of $m$ copies of $1$ evaluates to zero.
>
>>If the order is infinite, the field is said to have *characteristic zero*.^[Michael Artin - "Algebra, 2nd edition" p.83]

>[!example] 
>Characteristic of field $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ is zero, when characteristic of field $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ is finite and equal to $p$.

>The characteristic of any field $F$ is either zero or a prime number.^[Michael Artin - "Algebra, 2nd edition" p.83-84]
>>[!proof]+
>>Let $\overline{0}$ and $\overline{1}$ denote the additive and the multiplicative identities in the field $F$, and if $k$ is a positive integer, we let $\overline{k}$ denote the sum of $k$ copies of $\overline{1}$. Suppose that characteristic $m$ is not zero. Then $\overline{1}$ generates a cyclic subgroup $H$ of $F^{+}$ of order $m$, and $\overline{m}=\overline{0}$. Suppose that $m$ isn't prime, say $m=rs$, with $1<r,s<m$. Then $\overline{r}$ and $\overline{s}$ are in the multiplicative group $F^{\times}=F\setminus{0}$, but the product $\overline{r}\overline{s}$, which is equal to $\overline{0}$, is not in $F^{\times}$. This contradicts the fact that $F^{\times}$ is a group. Therefore $m$ must be prime.
