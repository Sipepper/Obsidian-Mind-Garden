>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>The set $G$ with associative binary algebraic operation with neutral element is called the *monoid*.^[С.Ленг - "Алгебра" p.17-20]

>Multiplication of sequence of elements can be defined vie induction $$\prod_{\nu=1}^{n}x_{\nu}=x_{1}\dots x_{n}=(x_{1}\dots x_{n-1})x_{n}$$

>Because our operation is associative all we can interchange brackets in any order.

#### Commutative monoid
>If operation in monoid $G$ is commutative, we say that monoid is itself *commutative* (or *abelian*).

#### Case of arbitrary cardinality
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $G$ be a commutative monoid, $I$ - some indexing set, and let $f:I\to G$ is a mapping such that $f(i)=e$ for almost all $i\in I$ except finite number. Let $I_{0}$ be some subset of $I$, which consists of all $i$ for which $f(i)\ne e$. By $$\prod_{i\in I}f(i)$$ we mean $$\prod_{i\in I_{0}}f(i)$$ taken in arbitrary order. Empty product is equal to $e$. 

#### Submonoid
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $H$ be some subset of the monoid $G$ which is closed under operation from $G$, such set is called the *submonoid* of monoid $G$.

>For any element $x$ of a monoid $G$ a subset of powers $x^{n}$ is a submonoid in $G$.
