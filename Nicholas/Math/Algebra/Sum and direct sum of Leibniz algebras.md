>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $L$ be a Leibniz algebra, $A,B\subseteq L$. Then
>$$A+B=\set{a+b:a\in A,b\in B}$$
>If $A$ and $B$ are subalgebras of $L$, the we say that $L$ - is the *sum* of subalgebras $A$ and $B$.

#### Direct sum
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $L$ be a Leibniz algebra, and $A,B$ are subalgebras of $L$, if $L$ is a direct sum of two subspaces $A$ and $B$, and 
>$$[A,B]=<0>$$
>then we say that $L$ is a *direct sum* of subalgebras $A$ and $B$, denoted as $L=A\oplus B$.
>

>We can generalize the direct sum to any finite number of subalgebras.
