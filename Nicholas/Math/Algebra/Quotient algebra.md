>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $I$ be an ideal of Lie algebra $L$, then it is also a subspace of $L$, therefore we can consider the following cosets
>$$x+I=\set{x+y:y\in I}$$
>where $x\in L$ and the quotient space
>$$L/I=\set{x+I:x\in L}$$
>we can define the law of composition(Lie bracket) on a set this set in the following way
>$$[x+I,y+I]=[x,y]+I\qquad x,y\in L$$
>then $L/I$ will be a Lie algebra, which said to be *quotient algebra* of $L$ by ideal $I$.
