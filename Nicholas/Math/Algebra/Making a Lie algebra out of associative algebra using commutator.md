>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $A$ be an associative algebra over a field $F$. Then we can introduce a new multiplication $[\cdot,\cdot]$ on $A$ with the same addition defined as
>$$[a,b]=ab-ba$$
>such multiplication is said to be a *commutator* of $a$ and $b$.

>[!example] 
>Let $M_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ be a vector space of matrices of size $n\times n$ over a field $\mathbb{R}$. We can form a lie algebra by commutator
>$$[A,B]=AB-BA$$
