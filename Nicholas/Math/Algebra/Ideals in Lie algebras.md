>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $I$ be some subspace of lie algebra $L$. If $[a,b]\in I$ for all $a\in L$ and $b\in I$ then $I$ is said to be the *ideal* in algebra $L$. In another words $I$ is ideal of $L$ if
>$$[L,I]\subseteq I$$
>by anticommutativity ($[a,b]=-[b,a]$) we have that
>$$[L,I]=[I,L]$$
>Ideals are denoted as $I\triangleleft L$. Algebra always has the $<0>$ and $L$ ideals. 

>Ideal is always a subalgebra
>>[!proof]
>>Let $I\triangleleft L$. Then
>>$$[I,I]\subseteq[L,I]\subseteq I$$
>>therefore $[I,I]\subseteq I$, and thus $I$ is a subalgebra of $L$. But the converse is *false* not all subalgebras are ideals.
