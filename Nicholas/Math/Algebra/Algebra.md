>Let $A$ be some vector space endowed with *vector multiplication* which satisfies following properties
>1. $(a+b)c=ac+bc\quad\forall a,b,c\in A$
>2. $a(b+c)=ab+ac\quad\forall a,b,c\in A$
>3. $(\lambda a)b=\lambda(ab)\quad\forall a,b\in A\quad\forall\lambda\in F$
>4. $a(\lambda b)=\lambda(ab)\quad\forall a,b\in A\quad\forall\lambda\in F$

>Then such vector space together with multiplication is said to be the *algebra* over the field $F$.

>Because algebra is a vector space we can speak about *basis of algebra* $A$ and dimension.

>*Basis* of an algebra $A$ is just a basis of corresponding vector space. Same with dimension.

#### Subalgebra
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $A$ be an algebra over a field $F$. Let $B$ be some subspace of a vector space $A$ which is invariant under algebra multiplication, i.e. also is an algebra. Then such subspace is said to be a *subalgebra* of algebra $A$, denoted as $B\le A$.

>[!example]
>

>Let $A$ be an algebra over a field $F$. A non-empty subset $B$ of $A$ is a subalgebra if and only if the following condition holds:
>1. if $a,b\in B$, then $a-b\in B$
>2. if $a,b\in B$, then $ab\in B$
>3. if $\lambda\in F$, $a\in B$, then $\lambda a\in B$
