#### Direct sum decomposition
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $L$ be a Lie algebra, $L$ is said to be the *direct sum* of subalgebras $A$ and $B$ if $L$ is a direct sum of vector spaces  $A$ and $B$, and 
>$$[A,B]=<0>$$
>This condition is equivalent to $A,B\triangleleft L$, i.e. $A$ and $B$ are ideals of $L$. The direct sum decomposition is denoted as 
>$$L=A\oplus B$$

>In similar manner we can define the direct sum of any finite number of subalgebras.
