>Let $(X,d)$ and $(Y,d_{1})$ be a metric spaces. Then space $(X,d)$ is called to be *isometric* to a space $(Y,d_{1})$ if exists some surjective mapping $f:X\to Y$ such that $$d(x_{1},x_{2})=d_{1}(f(x_{1}),f(x_{2}))\quad\forall x_{1},x_{2}\in X$$ Such mapping is called *isometry*.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.155]
