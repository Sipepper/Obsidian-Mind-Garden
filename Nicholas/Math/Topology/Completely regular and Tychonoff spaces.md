>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space. Then $(X,\tau)$ is said to be *completely regular* if for each $x\in X$ and each open set $U\ni x$, there exists a continuous function $f:(X,\tau)\to[0,1]$ such that $f(x)=0$ and $f(y)=1$ for all $y\in X\setminus U$. If $(X,\tau)$ is also Hausdorff, then it is said to be *Tychonoff space* (or a $T_{3\frac{1}{2}}$*-space*).^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=274|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.274]]]

>[!example]+ 
>The space $[0,1]$ (interval with Euclidean topology) is a Tychonoff space.

>>[!proof]+
>>Is a corollary of [[metric space is a Tychonoff space]].
