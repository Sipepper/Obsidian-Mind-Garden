>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space. An *n-dimensional chart* for $X$ at a point $x\in X$ is a homeomorphism $\Phi:U\to V$ where $U$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ and
>1. $V$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ or
>2. $V$ is an open subset of the upper half-space $H_{n}$ and $\Phi(x)$ lies in $\partial H_{n}$.
>
>In the former case we say that $\Phi$ is a chart of type $(i)$, in the latter case we say that $\Phi$ is a chart of type $(ii)$.^[Stefan Friedl - "Algebraic topology" p.261]
