>Let $(X_{1},\tau_{1}),\dots,(X_{n},\tau_{n}),\dots$ be a countably infinite family of topological spaces. Then the *box topology* $\tau'$ on the product $\prod_{i=1}^{\infty}X_{i}$, is that topology having as it's basis the family
>$$B'=\left\{\prod_{i=1}^{\infty}O_{i}:O_{i}\in\tau_{i}\right\}$$.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.225]
