>[!dsn]+ Proposition
>Let $M$ be a topological manifold. If $M$ is compact, then $\partial M$ is also compact.^[[[Stefan Friedl - Algebraic topology.pdf#page=265|Stefan Friedl - "Algebraic topology" p.265]]]

>[!proof]+
>By [[any union of components of the boundary of manifold is closed subset]] $\partial M$ is closed and thus by [[closed subset of compact space is compact]] $\partial M$ is compact.
