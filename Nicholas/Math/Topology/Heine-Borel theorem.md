>Every closed bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is a compact subset.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=182|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.182-183]]]

>[!proof]+
>Let $A$ be a closed bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$, then $A\subseteq[a,b]$, for some $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$. Because $[a,b]$ - compact and $A$ is a closed subset, then $A$ is compact.

>Every compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is closed and bounded.
>>[!proof]+
>>That follows from [[closed subset of compact space is compact]] and [[compact subset in euclidean topology is bounded]].

>Every subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $n\ge1$, is compact if and only if it's closed and bounded.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=184|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.184]]]
>>[!proof]+
>>

>This is only true for $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ space and it's subspaces,i.e. closed and bounded subsets of any other metric space need not to be compact.
