>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Every closed bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is a compact subset.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" c.182-183]

>[!proof]
>Let $A$ be a closed bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$, then $A\subseteq[a,b]$, for some $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$. Because $[a,b]$ - compact and $A$ is a closed subset, then $A$ is compact.

#### Inverse of Heine-Borel theorem
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Every compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is closed and bounded.

>[!proof]
>That follows from [[Closed subset of compact space is compact]] and [[Compact subset in euclidean topology is bounded]]
