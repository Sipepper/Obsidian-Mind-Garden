>$$D^{n}=\{(x_{1},\dots,x_{n}):x_{1}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}\le1\}$$
>is called the *closed $n$-cell*, furthermore homeomorphisms $f:D^{n}\to W$ and $f^{-1}:W\to D^{n}$ are smooth mappings, i.e. diffeomorphisms.^[Дж. Милнор,А.Уоллес - "Дифференциальная Топология" p.37]

>An *open cell* is a part of some closed cell, which under homeomorphisms above related to interior of a sphere.
