>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be a *Souslinn space*, if it is Hausdorff and a continuous image of a Polish space.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=154|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.154]]]

>[!example]+
>Because the real line is an example of Souslin space, then every topological space which is a continuous image of the real line is a Souslin space. 

>Every Polish space is a Souslin space.

>*Every countable topological space is a Souslin space* as it is a continuous image of the discrete space $\mathbb{N}$.
