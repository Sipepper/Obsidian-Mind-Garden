>[!dsn]+ Proposition
>Suppose $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds (without boundary), and $F:M\to N$ is a map.
>1. $F$ is a local diffeomorphism if and only if it is both a smooth immersion and a smooth submersion.
>2. If $\dim M=\dim N$ and $F$ is either a smooth immersion or a smooth submersion, then it is a local diffeomorphism.^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=98 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.80 ]]]
