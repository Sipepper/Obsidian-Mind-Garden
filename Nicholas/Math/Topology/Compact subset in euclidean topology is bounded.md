>A compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.182]

>[!proof]+
>Let $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be unbounded. Then $A\subseteq\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}(-n,n)$, but $\{(-n,n):n=1,2,3,\dots\}$ does not have any finite subcovering of $A$ as $A$ is unbounded. Therefore $A$ is not compact. Hence all compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are bounded.
