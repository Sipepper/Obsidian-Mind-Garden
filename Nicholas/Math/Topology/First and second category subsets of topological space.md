>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Let $Y$ be a subset of topological space $(X,\tau)$. If $Y$ is a union of a countable number of nowhere dense subsets of $X$, then $Y$ is said to be a set of the *first category* or *meager* in $(X,\tau)$. If $Y$ is not first category, it is said to be a set of the *second category* in $(X,\tau)$.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.166]
