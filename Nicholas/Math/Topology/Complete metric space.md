>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>A metric space $(X,d)$ is said to be *complete* if every Cauchy sequence in $(X,d)$ converges to a point in $(X,d)$.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.149]

>[!example] 
>Suppose we have the open interval $(0,1)$ with the euclidean metric $d$. It is clear that the sequence $0.1,0.01,0.001,\dots$ is a Cauchy sequence but it does not converge to any pont in $(0,1)$, therefore $(0,1)$ is not a complete metric space.

>Completeness is *not* a topological property, i.e. not preserved by homeomorphism.
>>[!proof]
>>From example above we know that $(0,1)$ is not complete, but by [[Real line with euclidean metric is a complete metric space]] we know that $\mathbb{R}$ is a complete metric space. And because $(0,1)$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are homeomorphic we can conclude that completeness is not a topological property.
