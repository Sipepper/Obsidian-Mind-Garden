>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be a *normal space* if for each pair of disjoint closed sets $A$ and $B$, there exist open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $A\subseteq U$, $B\subseteq V$ and $U\cap V=\emptyset$. A normal space which is also Hausdorff is said to be a $T_{4}$*-space*.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=277|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.277]]]
