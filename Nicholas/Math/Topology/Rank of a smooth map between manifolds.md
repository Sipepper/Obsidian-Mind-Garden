>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Suppose $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary. Given a smooth map $F:M\to N$ and a point $p\in M$,  the *rank of $F$ at $p$* is a rank of the linear map $dF_{p}:T_{p}M\to T_{F(p)}N$, i.e. the rank of the Jacobian matrix of $F$ in any smooth chart, or the dimension of $\operatorname{Im}dF_{p}\subseteq T_{F(p)}N$.^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=95 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.77 ]]]

>If $F$ has the same rank $r$ at every point, we say that is has *constant rank*, and write $\operatorname{rank}F=r$.

>If the rank of $dF_{p}$ is equal $\min\{\dim M,\dim N\}$ we say that $F$ *has full rank at $p$*, and if $F$ has full rank everywhere, we say $F$ *has full rank*.
