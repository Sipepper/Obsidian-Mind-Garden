>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be *regular* if for all $x\in X$ and all $U\in\tau$ such that $x\in U$, there exist $V\in\tau$ such that $x\in\overline{V}\subseteq U$.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=280|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.280]]]

>If $(X,\tau)$ is also a Hausdorff space, then it called $T_{3}$*-space*.

>Every subspace of regular space is regular.^[[[Glen E. Bredon - Geometry and Topology.pdf#page=26|Glen E. Bredon - "Geometry and Topology" p.13]]]
>>[!proof]+
>>Let $A\subset X$ be a subspace of $(X,\tau)$. By intersecting neighbourhood basis $\hat{\tau}$ of $X$ for a point $a\in A$ with $A$ we obtain a neighbourhood basis of $a$ in $A$.
