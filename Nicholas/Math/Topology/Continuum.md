>A topological space is said to be a *continuum* if it is compact and connected.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.215]

>Some authors say that topological space in definition must also be Hausdorff.

#### Product of continuums
>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Let $(X_{1},\tau_{1}),(X_{2},\tau_{2}),\dots,(X_{n},\tau_{n})$ be topological spaces. Then $\prod_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i},\tau_{i})$ is continuum if and only if each $(X_{i},\tau_{i})$ is a continuum.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.215]

>[!proof]+
>By [[Tychonoff's theorem]] and [[Finite product of connected spaces is connected]].
