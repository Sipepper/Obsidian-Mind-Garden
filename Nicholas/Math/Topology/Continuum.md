>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A topological space is said to be a *continuum* if it is compact and connected.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=215|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.215]]]

>Some authors say that topological space in definition must also be Hausdorff.

>[!example]+ 
>Consider closed interval $[a,b]$, it's a closed and bounded set and thus compact by [[Heine-Borel theorem]]. By [[connected subspaces of real line]] $[a,b]$ is connected. Therefore $[a,b]$ is a continuum.

>Let $(X_{1},\tau_{1}),(X_{2},\tau_{2}),\dots,(X_{n},\tau_{n})$ be topological spaces. Then $\prod_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i},\tau_{i})$ is continuum if and only if each $(X_{i},\tau_{i})$ is a continuum.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=215|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.215]]]
>>[!proof]+
>>It follows from [[Tychonoff's theorem]] and [[finite product of connected spaces is connected]].
>
>>[!example]+
>>As interval $[a,b]$ is a continuum, the product $[a,b]\times[a,b]$ is also a continuum. 
>>
>>More generally $n$-cube is also a continuum. [[n-cell]] and $n$-cube are also continuums.
