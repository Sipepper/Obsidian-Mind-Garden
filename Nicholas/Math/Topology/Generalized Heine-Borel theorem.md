>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Every subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $n\ge1$, is compact if and only if it's closed and bounded.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears"]

>This is only true for $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ space and it's subspaces,i.e. closed and bounded subsets of any other metric space need not to be compact.
