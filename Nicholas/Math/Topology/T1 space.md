#### Definition by closed points
>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be a $T_{1}$*-space* if every singleton set $\set{x}$, $x\in X$, is a closed set in $\tau$.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.239]

#### Definition by neighborhoods
>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be a $T_{1}$*-space* if for any two points $x\ne y$ there exists an open neighborhood of $x$ which don't contain $y$ and vice versa.^[Glen E. Bredon - "Topology and geometry" p.13]

#### Equivalence of definitions
>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Indeed, let's remove $x$ from $X$, and as open neighborhoods of $y$ which don't contain $x$, then $X\setminus\set{x}=\bigcup U_{y}$ be an open set as a union of open sets.
>
>Conversely, if $\set{x}$ is closed then open set $X\setminus\set{x}$ can be interpreted as open set containing any other point.
