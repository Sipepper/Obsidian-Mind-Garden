# Countable union of second countable spaces is second countable

>[!dsn]+ Proposition
>Let $X$ be a topological space. If there exists a countable family of open subsets $\{U_{i}\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ such that $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}U_{i}=X$ and if each $U_{i}$ is second-countable, then $X$ itself is second-countable.^[[[Stefan Friedl - Algebraic topology.pdf#page=260|Stefan Friedl - "Algebraic topology" p.260]]]

>[!proof]+
>For each $U_{i}$ we pick a countable basis $\mathcal{B}_{i}$ of the topology of $U_{i}$. We see that any open subset of $X$(maybe i should add more rigor afterwards) $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathcal{B}_{i}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$.
