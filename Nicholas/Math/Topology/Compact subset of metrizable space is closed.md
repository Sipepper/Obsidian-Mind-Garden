>A compact subset of a metrizable space is closed.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.182]

>[!proof]+
>As every metrizable space is a Hausdorff space, then by [[Compact subset of Hausdorff space is closed]] it is indeed a closed subset. 

>[!example]+ 
>For $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ with $a<b$, the intervals $[a,b)$ and $(a,b]$ are not compact as they are not closed subsets of the metrizable space $\mathbb{R}$.
