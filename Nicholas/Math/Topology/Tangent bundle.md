# Tangent bundle

>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. We say that disjoint union of tangent spaces at all points of $M$
>$$\coprod\limits_{p\in M}T_{p}M$$
>is a *tangent bundle of $M$* denoted by $TM$.^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=83 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.65 ]]]

>The tangent bundle comes equipped with a natural [[projection map]] $\pi:TM\to M$, which sends each vector in $T_{p}M$ to the point $p$ at which it is tangent: $\pi(p,v)=p$.
