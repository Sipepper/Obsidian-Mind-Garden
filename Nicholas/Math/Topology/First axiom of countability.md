>A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to satisfy the *first axiom of countability* (or to be *first countable*) if for each $x\in N$, there exists a countable family $U_{i}$, $i\in\mathbb{N}$ of open sets containing $x$, such that if $V\in\tau$ and $x\in V$, then $V\supseteq U_{n}$, for some $n$. That is $(X,\tau)$ has a countable neighbourhood basis at every point.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.300]

>Every metric space is second countable.
