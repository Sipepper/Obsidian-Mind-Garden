>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $(X,\tau)$ be a Hausforff space. Then it is a continuous image of the Cantor Space if and only if it is compact and metrizable.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.251]

>[!proof]
>This is a corollary from [[About compact metrizable space as an image of continuous mapping of compact metric space]].
