>Topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be a *Hausdorff space*(or a *$T_{2}$-space*) if for each pair of distinct points $a$ and $b$ in $X$, there exist open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $a\in U$, $b\in V$ and $U\cap V=\emptyset$.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.133]

>[!example] 
>- $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ are Hausdorff spaces
>- Any set $X$ with at least $2$ elements and which has the indiscrete topology is *not* a Hausdorff space
>- Any metric space is a Hausdorff space
