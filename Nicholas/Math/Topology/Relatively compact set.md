>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A subset $A$ of a topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be *relatively compact* if its closure, $\overline{A}$, is compact.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=188|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.188]]]

>[!example]+ 
>Let $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ be Euclidean plane with usual topology, than open ball $B_{r}$ will be relatively compact, because closure $\overline{B_{r}}$ is a compact set.
