>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. For each $p\in M$ we can define the *cotangent space at $p$*, denoted by $T_{p}^{*}M$, to be the dual space to $T_{p}M$, i.e.
>$$T_{p}^{*}M=(T_{p}M)^{*}$$

>Elements of $T_{p}^{*}M$ are called *tangent covectors at $p$*, or just *covectors at $p$*.^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=293 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.275 ]]]
