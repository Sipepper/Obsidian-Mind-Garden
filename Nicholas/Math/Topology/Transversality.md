#### Of submanifolds
>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold. Two embedded submanifolds $S,S'\subseteq M$ are said to *intersect transversely* if for each $p\in S\cap S'$, the tangent spaces $T_{p}S$ and $T_{p}S'$ together span $T_{p}M$ (where we consider $T_{p}S$ and $T_{p}S'$ as subspaces of $T_{p}M$).^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=161 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.143 ]]]

#### Of a map
>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $F:N\to M$ be a smooth map between manifolds $N$ and $M$. Suppose that $S\subseteq M$ is an embedded submanifold, we say that $F$ is *transverse to $S$* if for every $x\in F^{-1}(S)$, the spaces $T_{F(x)}S$ and $dF_{x}(T_{x}N)$ together span $T_{F(x)}M$.^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=161 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.143 ]]]

>If $F$ is a smooth submersion, then it is automatically transverse to every embedded submanifold of $M$.

>Two embedded submanifolds intersect transversely if and only if the inclusion of either one is transverse to the other.
