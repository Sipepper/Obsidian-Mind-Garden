>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. Then the collection of open balls in $(X,d)$ is a basis for a topology $\tau$ on $X$. The topology $\tau$ in this cased is referred to as *the topology induced by the metric $d$*.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.131]

>[!proof]
>This follows from [[Topology basis|necessary and sufficient conditions to be a basis for a topology]] and [[Open ball in metric space|intersection of two open balls is a union of open balls]].

>[!example] 
>If $d$ is the euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R}$ then a basis for the topology $\tau$ induced by the metric $d$ is the set of all open balls. But $B_{\delta}(a)=(a-\delta,a+\delta)$. From this it s readily seen that $\tau$ is the euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$. So *the euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R}$ induces the euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$*.

>[!example]
>If $d$ is the discrete metric on a set $X$ then for each $x\in X$, $B_{\frac{1}{2}}\{x\}$. So all singleton sets are open in the topology $\tau$ induced on $X$ by $d$. Consequently, $\tau$ is the discrete topology.
