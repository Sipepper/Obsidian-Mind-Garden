>Topological vector space $(V,\tau)$ is said to be *normable* if there exists a norm, such that corresponding metric induces a topology $\tau$.^[[[Fabio Silva Botelho - Functional Analysis and Applied Optimization in Banach Spaces.pdf#page=31|Fabio Silva Botelho - "Functional analysis and applied optimization in Banach spaces" p.13]]]
