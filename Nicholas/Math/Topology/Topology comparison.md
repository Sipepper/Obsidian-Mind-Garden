>Let $\tau_{1}$ and $\tau_{2}$ be topologies on a set $X$. Then $\tau_{1}$ is said to be a *finer topology* than $\tau_{2}$ (and $\tau_{2}$ is said to be a *coarser topology* than $\tau_{1}$) if $\tau_{1}\supseteq\tau_{2}$.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.198]

>[!example]+ 
>The discrete topology on a set $X$ is finer than any other topology on $X$. The indiscrete topology on $X$ is coarser than any other topology on $X$.
>>[!proof]+
>>Because any topology is defined as subset of a power set, and every topology must have $\emptyset$ and $X$(whole set).
