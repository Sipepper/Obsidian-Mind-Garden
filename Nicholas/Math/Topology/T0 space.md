>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be a *$T_{0}$-space* if for any two distinct points $x,y$ there exists an open set which contains one point but not another.^[[[Glen E. Bredon - Geometry and Topology.pdf#page=26|Glen E. Bredon - "Geometry and Topology" p.13]]]

>In another words, points in $T_{0}$ can be distinguished by open sets to which they belongs.
