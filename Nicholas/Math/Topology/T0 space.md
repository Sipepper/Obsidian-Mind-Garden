>Topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be a *$T_{0}$-space* if for any two distinct points $x,y$ there exists an open set which contains one point but not another.^[Glen E. Bredon - "Topology and geometry" p.13]

>In another words, points in $T_{0}$ can be distinguished by open sets to which they belongs.
