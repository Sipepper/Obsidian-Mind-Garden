>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A subset $A$ of topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be *nowhere dense* if $\text{Int}(\overline{A})=\emptyset$.
>loosely speaking, nowhere dense set is a set whose elements are not tightly clustered.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowhere_dense_set#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20a%20subset%20of,topology%20on%20the%20space)%20anywhere.]

>Equivalently a subset $S$ of $(X,\tau)$ is said to be nowhere dense in $X$ if $S$ is not dense in any nonempty open subset $U$ of $X$.
