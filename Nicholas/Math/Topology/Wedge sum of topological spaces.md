>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $\{(X_{i},p_{i})\}$ be a family of pointed topological spaces. The quotient space $\left(\bigsqcup_{i\in I}(X_{i},p_{i})\right)\Big/\sim$ ,with $\sim$ identifying all points $p_{i}$, denoted as $\bigvee (X_{i},p_{i})$ is called the *wedge sum*.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_sum]
