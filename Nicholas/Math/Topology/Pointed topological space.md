>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $(X,\tau)$ be topological space and $x_{0}$ be a point of $(X,\tau)$, then pair $(X,x_{0})$ is called the *pointed topological space*.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointed_space]

>Continuous maps between pointed spaces must not only be continuous in common sence, but map base points points to base points that is
>$$f:(X,x_{0})\to(Y,y_{0})\quad f(x_{0})=y_{0}$$
