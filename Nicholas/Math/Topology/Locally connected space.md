>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be *locally connected* if it has a basis of connected (open) sets.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=252|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.252]]]

>[!example]+ 
>Every discrete space is locally connected as are $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\mathbb{S}^{n}$, for all $n\ge1$.
>>[!proof]+
>>

>Not every connected space is locally connected.^[Sidney A. Morris "Topology without tears" p.252]
