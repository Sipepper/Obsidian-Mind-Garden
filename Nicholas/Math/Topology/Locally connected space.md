>A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be *locally connected* if it has a basis of connected (open) sets.^[Sidney A. Morris "Topology without tears" p.252]

>[!example]+ 
>Every discrete space is locally connected as are $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\mathbb{S}^{n}$, for all $n\ge1$.

>Not every connected space is locally connected.^[Sidney A. Morris "Topology without tears" p.252]
