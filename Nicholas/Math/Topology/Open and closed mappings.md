>Let $(X,\tau)$ and $(Y,\tau_{1})$ be topological spaces and $f$ a mapping from $X$ into $Y$. Then $f$ is said to be an *open mapping* if for every $A\in\tau$, $f(A)\in\tau_{1}$. The mapping $f$ is said to be a *closed mapping* if for every closed set $B$ in $(X,\tau)$, $f(B)$ is closed in $(Y,\tau_{1})$.^[Sidney A. Morris "Topology without tears" p.198]
