>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $(X,d)$ and $(Y,d_{1})$ be metric spaces and $f$ a mapping of $X$ into $Y$. If $(Y,d_{1})$ is a complete metric space, $f:(X,d)\to(Y,d_{1})$ is an isometric embedding and $f(X)$ is a dense subset of $Y$ in the associated topological space, then $(Y,d_{1})$ is said to be a *completion* of $(X,d)$.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=155|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.155]]]

>[!example]+ 
>$\mathbb{R}$ with the euclidean metric is a completion of $\mathbb{Q}$, the set of rationals with the euclidean metric.
>
>Also $\mathbb{R}$ with the euclidean metric is a completion of $\mathbb{I}$, the set of irrationals with the euclidean metric.
