>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Let $F:M\to N$ be a smooth map between manifolds $M$ and $N$, and $(U,\phi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ are any smooth charts for $M$ and $N$, respectively. We call $\hat F=\psi\circ F\circ\phi^{-1}$ the *coordinate representation of $F$* with respect to the given coordinates. It maps the set $\phi(U\cap F^{-1}(V))$ to $\psi(V)$.^[[[John M.
