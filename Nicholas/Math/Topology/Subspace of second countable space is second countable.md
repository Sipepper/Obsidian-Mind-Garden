>[!dsn] Body of the problem
>Let $(Y,\tau_{1})$ be a subspace of a topological space $(X,\tau)$. If $(X,\tau)$ satisfies the second axiom of countability, show that $(Y,\tau_{1})$ also satisfies the second axiom of countability.^[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears p.94]

>[!proof]
>Suppose $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis of $(X,\tau)$. As $(X,\tau)$ is second countable $\mathcal{B}$ we assume that $\mathcal{B}$ is countable(without loss of generality). Then by definition of [[Subspace topology]] $\mathcal{B}_{Y}=\mathcal{B}\cap Y$. Therefore as $\mathcal{B}$ is countable, so is $\mathcal{B}\cap Y$. Thus $Y$ is second countable.
