>Let $(X,d)$ and $(Y,d_{1})$ be metric spaces and $f$ a mapping of $X$ into $Y$. Let $Z=f(X)$, and $d_{2}$ be the metric induced on $Z$ by $d_{1}$. If $f:(X,d)\to(Z,d_{2})$ is an isometry, then $f$ is said to be an *isometric embedding* of $(X,d)$ in $(Y,d_{1})$.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.155]

>[!example] 
>The natural embedding of $\mathbb{Q}$ with the euclidean metric in $\mathbb{R}$ with the euclidean metric is an isometric embedding. It is also the case that $\mathbb{N}$ with the euclidean metric has a natural isometric embedding into both $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ with the euclidean metric.
