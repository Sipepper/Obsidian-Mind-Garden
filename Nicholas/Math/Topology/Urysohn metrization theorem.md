>[!dsn]+ Theorem
>Every regular second countable Hausdorff space is metrizable.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=284|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.284]]]

>[!proof]+
>Let $(X,\tau)$ be a regular and Hausdorff space, that is $T_{3}$ space. Also $(X,\tau)$ satisfies the second axiom of countability.
>First we use a fact that [[every regular second countable space is normal]], thus $(X,\tau)$ is a normal space. Then as [[every normal second countable Hausdorff space is metrizable]] $(X,\tau)$ is metrizable, which completes the proof.
