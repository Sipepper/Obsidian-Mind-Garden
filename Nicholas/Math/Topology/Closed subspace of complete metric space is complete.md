>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, $Y$ a subset of $X$, and $d_{1}$ the metric induced on $Y$ by $d$.
>1. If $(X,d)$ is a complete metric space and $Y$ is a closed subspace of $(X,d)$, then $(Y,d_{1})$ is a complete metric space.
>2. If $(Y,d_{1})$ is a complete metric space, then $Y$ is a closed subspace of $(X,d)$.
