>[!dsn]+ Proposition
>For any smooth $n$-manifold $M$, the tangent bundle $TM$ has a natural topology and smooth structure that make it into a $2n$-dimensional smooth manifold. With respect to this structure, the projection $\pi:TM\to M$ is smooth.^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=84 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.66 ]]]
