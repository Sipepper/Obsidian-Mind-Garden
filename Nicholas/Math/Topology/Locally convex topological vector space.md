#### Definition via convex sets
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Topological vector space $U$ is said to be *locally convex* if there exists a neighborhood basis $\Omega$ consisting of convex sets.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_convex_topological_vector_space]

#### Definition via seminorms
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>A *locally convex space* is defined to be a vector space $U$ together with a family $\mathcal{P}$ of seminorms on $U$.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_convex_topological_vector_space]
