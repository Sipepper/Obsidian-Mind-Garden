#### By basis of relatively compact sets
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be *locally compact* if exist a basis for $\tau$ which consists of relatively compact subsets of $X$.^[Cornelia Drutu, Michael Kapovich - "Geometric group theory" c.7]
#### By compact neighbourhoods
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be *locally compact* if each point $x\in X$ has at least one neighbourhood which is compact.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.189]
