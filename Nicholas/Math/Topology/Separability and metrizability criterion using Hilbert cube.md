>Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space. Then $(X,\tau)$ is separable and metrizable if and only if it is homeomorhpic to a subspace of the Hilbert cube.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.242]

>$\Rightarrow$
>If $(X,\tau)$ is separable and metrizalble, then by [[every separable metric space is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Hilbert cube]] we know that $(X,\tau)$ is homeomorphic to some subspace of a Hilbert cube.

>Conversely, let $(X,\tau)$ be homeomorphic to the subspace $(Y,\tau_{1})$ of the Hilbert cube $I^{\infty}$. By [[compact metrizable space is separable]], $I^{\infty}$ is separable. So by [[separability criterion for metric spaces]] it is second countable. By [[subspace of second countable space is second countable]], and hence $(Y,\tau_{1})$ is second countable. Also by [[Subspace of metrizable space is metrizable]] we know that any subspace of metrizable space is metrizable. As the Hilbert cube is metrizable, it's subspace $(Y,\tau_{1})$ is metrizable. So $(Y,\tau_{1})$ is metrizable and satisfies the second axiom of countability. Therefore it is separable. Hence $(X,\tau)$ is also separable and metrizable.
