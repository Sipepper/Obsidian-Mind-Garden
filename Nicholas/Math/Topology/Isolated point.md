>Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space. A point $x\in X$ is said to be *isolated* if there exist an open neighborhood $U$ such that $U$ not intersects $X\setminus\{x\}$.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_point] 


#### In metric space
>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>A point $x$ of a metric space $(X,d)$ is called *isolated* if there exists $\varepsilon>0$ such that $B(x,\varepsilon)\cap X=\{x\}$.^[Marcel Berger - "Geometry 1" p.15]
