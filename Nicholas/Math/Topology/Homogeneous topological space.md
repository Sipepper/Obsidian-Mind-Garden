>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be *homogeneous* if it has the property that for each ordered pair $(x,y)$ of points of $X$, there exists a homeomorphism $f:(X,\tau)\to(X,\tau)$ such that $f(x)=y$.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=515|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.515]]]

>A topological homogeneous spaces can be considered as a special case of [[Homogeneous space under group action]] with group of homeomorphisms $\text{Homeo}(X)$ acting on a topological space $(X,\tau)$ transitively.

>[!example]+ 
>A topological vector space is an example of Homogeneous spaces, with translations as homeomorphisms by continuity of operation for [[Topological vector space]].^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_space]
