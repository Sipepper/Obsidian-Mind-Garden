>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be *totally disconnected* if every non-empty connected subset is a singleton set.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=121|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.121]]]

>$(X,\tau)$ is totally disconnected if and only if for each $a\in X$, $C_{X}(a)=\{a\}$.
>>[!proof]+

>Every subspace of a totally disconnected space is totally disconnected
>>[!proof]+
>>

>[!example]+ 
>The set $\mathbb{Q}$ with usual topology is totally disconnected.
