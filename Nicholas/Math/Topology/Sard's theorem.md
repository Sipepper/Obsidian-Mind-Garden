>[!dsn]+ Theorem
>Suppose $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary and $F:M\to N$ is a smooth map. Then the set of critical values of $F$ has measure zero in $N$.^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=147 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.129 ]]]
