>Let $f:(X,\tau)\to(Y,\tau_{1})$ be a continuous bijection. If $(X,\tau)$ is compact and $(Y,\tau_{1})$ is Hausdorff, then $f$ is a homeomorhphism.^[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3042668/continuous-bijection-between-compact-and-hausdorff-spaces-is-a-homeomorphism]

>[!proof]+
>As $f$ is surjective then as [[Compactness is preserved under surjective continuous mapping]] $Y$ is compact. As $Y$ is Hausdorff $Y$ is closed by [[Compact subset of Hausdorff space is closed]].   That is $f$ is a closed map. Which is equivalent to say that $f^{-1}$ (inverse mapping) is continuous. Therefore $f$ is a homeomorphism.
