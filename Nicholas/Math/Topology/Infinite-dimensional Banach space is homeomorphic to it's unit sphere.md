>Let $B$ be an infinite-dimensional Banach space, $S=\{x:x\in B,\|x\|=r\}$ a sphere in $B$ of radius $r>0$, and $C=\{x:x\in B,\|x\|\le r\}$ a closed ball in $B$. Then $B,S$ and $C$ are homeomorphic.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" c.256]

>Let $N$ be an infinite-dimensional normed vector space and $O=\set{x:\|x\|<1}$ an open ball in $N$ of radius $1$. Observe that $x\mapsto\frac{x}{1+\|x\|}$ is a continuous map of $N$ onto $O$ with continuous inverse $x\mapsto\frac{x}{1-\|x\|}$. So the open unit ball $O$ is homeomorphic to $N$. Indeed every open ball in $N$ is homeomorphic to $N$.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" c.256]
