>Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ which is bounded above and let $p$ be the supremum of $S$. If $S$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$, then $p\in S$.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.85]

>[!proof]
>Suppose $p\in\mathbb{R}\setminus S$. As $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is open there exist real numbers $a$ and $b$ with $a<b$ such that $p\in(a,b)\subseteq\mathbb{R}\setminus S$. As $p$ is the least upper bound for $S$ and $a<p$, it is clear that there exists an $x\in S$ such that $a<x$. Also $x<p<b$, and so $x\in(a,b)\subseteq\mathbb{R}\setminus S$. But this is a contradiction, since $x\in S$. Hence our supposition is false and $p\in S$.
