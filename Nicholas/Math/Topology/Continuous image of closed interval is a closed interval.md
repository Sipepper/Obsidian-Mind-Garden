>[!dsn]+ Proposition
>Let $a$ and $b$ be in $\mathbb{R}$ and $f$ a continous function from $[a,b]$ into $\mathbb{R}$. Then $f([a,b])=[c,d]$, for some $c$ and $d$ in $\mathbb{R}$.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=184|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.184]]]

>[!proof]+
>As $[a,b]$ is connected, $f([a,b])$ is a connected subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and hence is an interval. As $[a,b]$ is compact, $f([a,b])$ is compact. So $f([a,b])$ is a closed bounded interval. Hence
>$$f([a,b])=[c,d]$$
>for some $c$ and $d$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
