# Limit point in topological space

>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $(X,\tau)$. A point $x\in X$ is said to be a *limit point* (or *accumulation point* or *cluster point*) *of $A$* if every open set, $U$, containing $x$ contains a point of $A$ different from $x$.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=73|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.73]]]

>[!example]+ Limit points in discrete space 
>Let $(X,\tau)$ be a discrete space and $A$ is a subset of $X$. Then $A$ has no limit points, since for each $x\in X$, $\{x\}$ is an open set containing no point of $A$ different from $x$.

>[!example]+ Limit points in indiscrete space
>Let $(X,\tau)$ be an indiscrete space and $A$ a subset of $X$ with at least two elements. Then every point of $X$ is a limit point of $A$.

>A point $x\in X$ is a limit point of $A$ if and only if every neighbourhood of $x$ contains a point of $A$ different from $x$.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=81|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.81]]]
>Essentialy it's just an equivalent definition of a limit point.
