>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $(X,\tau)$ and $(Y,\tau_{1})$ be topological spaces, $f:(X,\tau)\to(Y,\tau_{1})$ a continuous mapping, $A$ a subset of $X$, and $\tau_{2}$ the subspace topology on $A$. Further let $g:(A,\tau_{2})\to(Y,\tau_{1})$ be the restriction of $f$ to $A$; that is, $g(x)=f(x)$, for all $x\in A$. Then $g$ is continuous.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.115]
