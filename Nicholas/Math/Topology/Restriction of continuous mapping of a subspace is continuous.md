# Restriction of continuous mapping of a subspace is continuous

>[!dsn]+ Proposition
>Let $(X,\tau)$ and $(Y,\tau_{1})$ be topological spaces, $f:(X,\tau)\to(Y,\tau_{1})$ a continuous mapping, $A$ a subset of $X$, and $\tau_{2}$ the subspace topology on $A$. Further let $g:(A,\tau_{2})\to(Y,\tau_{1})$ be the restriction of $f$ to $A$; that is, $g(x)=f(x)$, for all $x\in A$. Then $g$ is continuous.^[[[Sidney A.
