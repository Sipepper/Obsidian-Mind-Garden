>Let $X$ be a topological space. If $X$ has only finitely many components, then each component is also an open subset of $X$.^[[[Stefan Friedl - Algebraic topology.pdf#page=137|Stefan Friedl - "Algebraic topology" p.137]]]

>[!proof]+
>Suppose that $X$ has only finitely many components. Let $C$ be a component of $X$. As [[Component of topological space#Component is a closed subset|component is a closed set]] $C$ is closed. By definition the complement of $C$ is the union of all other components. Since there are only finitely many and since they are closed, it follows that the complement of $C$ is closed, i.e. $C$ is open.
