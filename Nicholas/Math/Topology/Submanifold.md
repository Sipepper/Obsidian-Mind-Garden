#### Embedded submanifolds
>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. An *embedded submanifold of $M$* is a subset $S\subseteq M$ that is a manifold(without boundary) in the subspace topology, endowed with a smooth structure with respect to which the inclusion map $S\hookrightarrow M$ is a smooth embedding.^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=116 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.98 ]]]

>Embedded submanifolds are also called *regular submanifolds*.


#### Immersed submanifolds
>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. An *immersed submanifolds of $M$* is a subset $S\subseteq M$ endowed with a topology (not necessarily the subspace topology) with respect to which it is a topological manifolds (without boundary), and a smooth structure with respect to which the inclusion map $S\hookrightarrow M$ is a smooth immersion.^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=126 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.108 ]]]

>Embedded submanifold is a special case of immersed one.
