>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Let $X$ be a topological manifold. A point $x\in X$ is said to be *boundary point* if $x$ does not admit a chart of type $(i)$(chart to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and not to $H_{n}$).

>Set of all boundary points is called *boundary* and denoted as $\partial X$.^[Stefan Friedl - "Algebraic topology" p.262]
