>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $I$ - some indexing set and let $\{(X_{i},\tau_{i}):i\in I\}$ - family of topological spaces and $(\prod_{i\in I}X_{i},\tau)$ their product space. If for all $i\in I$, $B_{i}$ is a basis for $\tau_{i}$, then $$\mathfrak{B}'=\left\{\prod_{i\in I}O_{i}:O_{i}\in B_{i},O_{i}=X_{i}\;\text{for all but finite number of}\;i\;\right\}$$ is a basis for $\tau'$.^[Sidney A.
