>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to satisfy the *second axiom of countability* (or to be *second countable*) if there exists a basis $\mathfrak{B}$ for $\tau$ such that $\mathfrak{B}$ consists of only a countable number of sets.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.241 ]

>[!example] 
>Let $\mathfrak{B}=\left\{\left(q-\frac{1}{n},q+\frac{1}{n} \right):q\in\mathbb{Q},n\in\mathbb{N}\right\}$. Then $\mathfrak{B}$ is a basis for the euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$. Therefore $\mathbb{R}$ is second countable.
>>[!proof]
>>

>[!example]
>Let $(X,\tau)$ be an uncountable se with the discrete topology. Then, as every singleton set must be in any basis for $\tau$, $(X,\tau)$ does not have any countable basis. So $(X,\tau)$ is not second countable.
