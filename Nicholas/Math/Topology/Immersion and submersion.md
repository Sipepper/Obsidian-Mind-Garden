#### Immersion
>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A smooth map $F:M\to N$ is called a *smooth immersion* if its differential is injective at each point (or equivalently, if $\operatorname{rank}F=\dim N$).^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=78 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.96 ]]]

#### Submersion
>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A smooth map $F:M\to N$ is called a *smooth submersion* if its differential is surjective at each point (or equivalently, if $\operatorname{rank}F=\dim N$).^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=96 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.78 ]]]
