>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on a topological space $X$. If we denote by $p:X\to X/\sim$ the canonical projection map from $X$ onto the set of equivalence classes $X/\sim$, then if $X$ is compact, then $X/\sim$ is also compact.^[Stefan Friedl - "Algebraic topology" p.177]

>[!proof]+
>As projection map(i.e. quotient map) is continuous, by [[continuous image of compact space is compact]] $p(X)=X/\sim$ is compact space.
