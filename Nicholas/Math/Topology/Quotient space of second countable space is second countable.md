>Let $X$ be a topological space and let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $X$. If $X$ is second-countable and if the projection $X\to X/\sim$ is an open map, then $X/\sim$ is also second-countable.^[Stefan Friedl - "Algebraic topology" p.260-261]

>[!proof]+
>By [[Image of basis under quotient map is a basis in quotient topology]] if $X$ has countable basis $\mathcal{B}$, so does $X/\sim$, as $p(\mathcal{B})$ is a basis for quotient topology on $X/\sim$ and by [[Properties of countable sets]] $p(\mathcal{B})$ is countable.
