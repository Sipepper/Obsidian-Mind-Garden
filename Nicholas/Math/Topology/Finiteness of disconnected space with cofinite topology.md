>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $\tau$ be a cofinite topology on a set $X$. If $X$ has at least $3$ distinct clopen subsets, then $X$ is a finite set.^[Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.40]

>[!proof]
>As our space $(X,\tau)$ has $3$ distinct clopen subsets, we know that there is a clopen subset $S$ of $X$ such that $S\ne X$ and $S\ne\emptyset$. As $S$ is open in $(X,\tau)$. Then it's complement $X\setminus S$ is a closed set.
>
>Thus $S$ and $X\setminus S$ are closed in the finite-closed topology $\tau$. Therefore $S$
 and $X\setminus S$ are both finite, since neither equals $X$. But $X=S\cup(X\setminus S)$ and so $X$ is the union of two finite sets. Thus $X$ is a finite set, as required.
