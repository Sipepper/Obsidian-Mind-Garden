>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold with or without boundary. With its standard projection map and the natural vector space structure on each fiber, the cotangent bundle $T^{*}M$ has a unique topology and smooth structure making it into a smooth rank-$n$ vector bundle over $M$ for which all coordinate covector field are smooth local sections.^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=294 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.276 ]]]
