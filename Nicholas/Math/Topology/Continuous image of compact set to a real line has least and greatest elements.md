>[!dsn]+ Theorem
>Let $(X,\tau)$ be a compact space and $f$ a continuous mapping from $(X,\tau)$ into $\mathbb{R}$. Then the set $f(X)$ has a greatest element and a least element.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=184|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.184]]]

>It's also called *Maximum-value theorem*.^[[[Yukio Matsumoto - An introduction to Morse theory.pdf#page=32|Yukio Matsumoto - "An introduction to Morse theory" p.18]]]

>[!proof]+
>As $f$ is continuous, $f(X)$ is compact. Therefore by [[compact subset in euclidean topology is bounded]] $f(X)$ is a closed bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$. As $f(X)$ is bounded, it has a supremum. Since $f(X)$ is closed, [[closed bounded subset of real line contains it's supremum]] implies that the supremum is in $f(X)$. Thus $f(X)$ has a greatest element - namely its supremum. Similarly it can be shown that $f(X)$ has a least element.
