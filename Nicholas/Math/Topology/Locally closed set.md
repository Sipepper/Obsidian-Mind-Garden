>A subset $Y$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be *locally closed* if for every point $y\in Y$ there exists a open neighbourhood $V\subset X$ such that $Y\cap V$ is closed in $V$.^[Alain M. Robert - "A course in p-adic analysis" p.20]

>It is equivalent to say that $Y$ is locally closed if and only if $Y$ is open in it's closure $\overline{Y}$.
>>[!proof]+
>>

>If $X$ is a Hausdorff space, then locally compact subsets of $X$ are locally closed, as compact subsets of Hausdorff space are closed.
