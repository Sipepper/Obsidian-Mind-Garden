>A subset $Y$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be *locally closed* if for every point $y\in Y$ there exists a open neighbourhood $V\subset X$ such that $Y\cap V$ is closed in $V$.^[Alain M. Robert - "A course in p-adic analysis" p.20]

>It is equivalent to say that $Y$ is locally closed if and only if $Y$ is open in it's closure $\overline{Y}$.

>>Suppose that $Y$ is locally closed, i.e. for every point $y\in Y$ there exist an open neighborhood $V\subset X$ such that $Y\cap V$ is closed in $V$. 
>>Now consider a subspace topology on $\overline{Y}$, that is every open set in $\overline{Y}$ is of the form $V\cap\overline{Y}$. Then as $Y\cap V$ is closed in $V$, then

>If $X$ is a Hausdorff space, then locally compact subsets of $X$ are locally closed, as compact subsets of Hausdorff space are closed.
