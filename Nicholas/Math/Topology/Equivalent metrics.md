>Two metrics $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ called *equivalent*, if they are inducing a same topology.^[[[Sidney A. Morris - Topology without tears.pdf#page=132|Sidney A. Morris - "Topology without tears" p.132]]]

>If 
>$$\forall \varepsilon_{1}>0 \quad d_{1}(x,y)<\varepsilon_{1}\quad\Rightarrow\quad \exists\delta_{1}\quad d_{2}(x,y)<\delta_{1}$$ 
>and 
>$$\forall \varepsilon_{1}>0 \quad d_{2}(x,y)<\varepsilon_{2}\quad\Rightarrow\quad \exists\delta_{2}\quad d_{1}(x,y)<\delta_{2}$$ then this two metrics are equivalent.

>In other words, different balls from metrics can be put in each other, only by changing the radius.

>[!example] 
>
>In $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with euclidean metric, $B_{r}(a)$ is the open disc with centre $a$ and radius $r$.
>
>In $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with the metric $d^{*}$ given by
>$$d^{*}\left((a_{1},a_{2}),(b_{1},b_{2})\right)=\max\set{|a_{1}-b_{1}|,|a_{2}-b_{2}|}$$
>the open ball $B_{1}((0,0))$ looks like square with sidelength $1$.
>Then $d$ and $d^{*}$ is equivalenct, as we always can fit square into circle by scaling it and vice versa.
