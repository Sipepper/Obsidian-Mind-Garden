>Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space. Let $\hat{\tau}$ be a family of neighborhoods of $x$. Then $\hat{\tau}$ is said to be the *neighborhood basis* at $x$ if and only if
>- For each neighborhood $N$ of $x$, there is an $M\in\hat{\tau}$ such that $M\subseteq N$.^[https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Neighborhood_Basis]
