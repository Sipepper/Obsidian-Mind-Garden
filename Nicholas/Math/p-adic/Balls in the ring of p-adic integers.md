>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A *ball* $B_{<r}(a)$ centered at point $a$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is defined as $d(x,a)=|x-a|_{p}<r$.^[[[Alain M. Robert - A course in p-adic analysis.pdf#page=27 |Alain M. Robert - "A course in p-adic analysis" p.11]]]

>A ball $B_{<r}(a)$ will not change if we replace $r$ with smallest $p^{-n}\ge r$. 
>>[!proof]+
>>It follows from the definition of $p$-adic metric.

>If the $p$-adic expansion of $a$ is $a_{0}+a_{1}p+\dots+a_{n}p^{n}+\dots=s_{n}+p^{n+1}\alpha$ .A ball $B_{<r}(a)<p^{-n}$ is not change if we replace it's center $a$ with $s_{n}$. Thus ball is fully determined by the sequence of digits $a_{0},a_{1},\dots,a_{n}$, and we can associate it's sequence to a word in free monoid $\mathcal{M}_{p}$ generated by $S=\set{0,1,\dots,p-1}$.
