>Ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ of $p$-adic integers is an integral domain.^[Alain M. Robert A Course in p-adic Analysis p.4-5]

>[!proof]+
>As $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is commutative ring, it's sufficient to prove that it has no dividers of zero. Then let $a=\sum_{i\ge0}a_{i}p^{i}\ne0$, $b=\sum_{i\ge0}b_{i}p^{i}\ne0$ and $v=v(a)$, $w=v(b)$.
>Then $a_{v}$ is a first non-zero coefficient of $a$, $0<a_{v}<p$ and $b_{w}$ is a first non-zero coefficient of $b$ respectively. In particular, $p\nmid a_{v}$ and $p\nmid b_{w}$, and thus $p\nmid a_{v}b_{w}$. By definition first non-zero coefficients of $ab$, $c_{v+w}$ before $p^{v+w}$, and defined as
>$$0<c_{v+w}<p \qquad c_{v+w}\equiv a_{v}b_{w}\mod{p}$$
