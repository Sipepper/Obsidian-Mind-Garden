>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>We can define a $p$*-adic metric* as 
>$$d(x,y)=\frac{1}{p^{v(x-y)}}$$
>where $v(x-y)$ is an order of $p$-adic number $x-y$. Or by $p$-adic norm
>$$d(x,y)=\|x-y\|_{p}$$

>With such metric, *multiplication by $p$* in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is a contraction mapping 
>$$d(px,py)=\frac{1}{p}d(x,y)$$
>and thus is continuous.^[Alain M. Robert "A Course in p-adic Analysis" c.7]
