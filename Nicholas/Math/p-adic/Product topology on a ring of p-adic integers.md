# Product topology on a ring of p-adic integers

###### tags: #p-adic

>[!dsn]+ Definition
>We can define topology on $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ by viewing set $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ as a product set
>$$\mathbb{Z}_{p}=\prod_{i\ge0}\{0,1,2,\dots,p-1\}=\{0,1,2,\dots,p-1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$$
>of finite discrete spaces.^[[[Alain M. Robert - A course in p-adic analysis.pdf#page=23 |Alain M. Robert - "A course in p-adic analysis" p.7]]]

>From Tychonoff's theorem we know that $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ will be compact space. Also $\mathbb{Z}$ is a totally disconnected space.
