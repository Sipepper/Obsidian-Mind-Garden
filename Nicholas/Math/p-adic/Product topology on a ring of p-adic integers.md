>We can define topology on $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ by viewing set $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ as a product set
>$$\mathbb{Z}_{p}=\prod_{i\ge0}\set{0,1,2,\dots,p-1}=\set{0,1,2,\dots,p-1}^{\mathbb{N}}$$
>of finite discrete spaces.^[Alain M. Robert "A Course in p-adic Analysis" c.7]

>From Tychonoff's theorem we know that $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ will be compact space. Also $\mathbb{Z}$ is a totally disconnected space.
