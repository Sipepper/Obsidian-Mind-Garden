>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$, and $\{v_{1},\dots,v_{n}\}$ - set of vectors. Then the *linear span* $\textbf{span}\{v_{1},\dots,v_{n}\}$ is defined as all possible linear combinations of vectors $v_{i}$, that is $$\textbf{span}\{v_{1},\dots,v_{n}\}=\{\alpha_{1}v_{1}+\alpha_{2}v_{2}+\dots+\alpha_{n}v_{n}:\alpha_{i}\in F\}$$

>Linear span is the smallest subspace which contains all vectors $v_{i}$.

>[!example] 
>Linear span of vectors $v_{1}=[3,2]^{t}$ and $v_{2}=[1,1]^{t}$ is equals to entire vector space $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, because every vector $v\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$. But vectors $w_{1}=[1,\frac{1}{2}]^{t}$ and $w_{2}=[4,2]^{t}$ are linearly dependent and thus don't span whole plane, but vector a subspace $\alpha\cdot[1,\frac{1}{2}]$.
