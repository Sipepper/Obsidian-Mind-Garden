#### Bounded set in metric spaces
>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Subset $A$ of a metric space $(X,d)$ is said to be *bounded* if there exist a real number $r$ such that
>$$d(a_{1},a_{2})\le r,\quad\forall a_{1},a_{2}\in A$$

>In other words subset $A$ is bounded if it has finite diameter.

#### Bounded set in topological vector spaces
>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Subset $A$ of topological vector space $U$ is said to be *bounded* if for every neighbourooh of zero $\mathcal{V}$ there exist a number $s>0$ such that $A\subset t\mathcal{V}$ for any $t>s$.^[Fabio Silva Botelho - "Functional analysis and applied optimization in Banach spaces" p.7]
