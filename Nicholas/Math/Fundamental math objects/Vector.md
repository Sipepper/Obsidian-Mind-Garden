>[!dsn]+ Definition
>*Vector* can be defined as an element of a vector space, i.e. elements linear combinations of which stays in the vector space. But suppose we have a finite dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with coordinates $(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})$. 
>
>A *vector at a point* $P=(x'_{1},\dots,x'_{n})$ is a tuple of numbers $(\xi_{1},\dots,\xi_{n})$ in basis $x_{i}$.
>The defining property of vector in a point, is how it's transforms under change of coordinates. Suppose we have new coordinates $z_{i}$ defined by a function $x=x(z)$, such that $x_{i}(z'_{1},\dots,z'_{n})=x'_{i}$, then
>$$\xi_{i}=\left(\frac{\partial x_{i}}{\partial z_{j}}\right)\Bigg|_{z_{k}=z'_{k}}\zeta_{j}$$
