#### TVS case
>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A subset $A$ of the topologival vector space $U$ which satisfies $$u,v\in A\Rightarrow\lambda u+(1-\lambda)v\in A,\quad\forall\lambda\in[0,1]$$ is called *convex set*.

>[!example]+
>The balls in euclidean space are example of convex sets. 

>[!example]+
>The set $P=\{(x,y):y>x^{2},\;\;x,y\in\mathbb{R}\}$ is also convex.

#### Metric spaces case
>[!dsn]+ Definition
>A subset $C$ of a metric space $(X,d)$ is said to be *convex* if every pair of points $x,y\in C$ can be joined by a geodesic in $X$ and the image of every such geodesic is contained in $C$.^[Martin R. Bridson, Andre Haefliger - "Metric spaces of non-positive curvature" p.4]
