>A *functional* is a certain type of function. And the exact formal definition is varies depending on the math area.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics)]


###### In linear algebra
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>It's synonymous with *linear forms*, which are linear mapping from a vector space $V$ into it's field of scalars.

>[!example]

###### In functional analysis
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>It's a mapping from a space $X$ into the field of real or complex numbers.

>[!example]
>The Riemann integral is a linear functional on the vector space of functions defined on $[a,b]$ that are Riemann-integrable from $a$ to $b$.
