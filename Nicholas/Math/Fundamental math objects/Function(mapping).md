>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $U$ and $V$ be a topological spaces. By the *function* people often mean the "mapping" $f:U\to V$ which consists of pairs $(u,v)\in U\times V$ such that for all $u\in U$ there exist only one element $v\in V$ such that $(u,v)\in f$.^[[[Fabio Silva Botelho - Functional Analysis and Applied Optimization in Banach Spaces.pdf#page=21|Fabio Silva Botelho - "Functional analysis and applied optimization in Banach spaces" p.3]]]

>In most cases map and function is a synonyms, only in extreme cases where category theory involved it may vary. Many authors use these words interchangebly.

#### Types of functions between sets
Let $f$ be a function from a set $X$ to set $Y$.
- Function $f$ is said to be *one-to-one* or *injective* if from $f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})$ follows that $x_{1}=x_{2}$, for any $x_{1},x_{2},\in X$, i.e. different arguments maps to different images. 
- A function $f$ is said to be *onto* or *surjective* if for any $y\in Y$ there exist $x\in X$ such that $f(x)=y$.
- A function $f$ is is said to be *bijective* if it's bijective and surjection(one-to-one and onto).
- A function $f$ is said to be *well-defined* if $g=h$ implies $f(g)=f(h)$.
