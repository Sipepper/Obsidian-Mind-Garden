#### Group isomorphism
>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>Let $\phi:G\to G'$ be the group homomorphism, if $\phi$ is also a bijection, then $\phi$ is said to be an *isomorphism*, denoted as $G\simeq G'$.

#### Vector space isomorphism
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Two vector spaces $V$ and $W$ over the same field $F$ are said to be *isomorphic* if there is a bijection $T:V\to W$ which preserves addition and scalar multiplication, that is $\forall u,v\in V$ and $c\in F$:
>$$T(u)+T(v)\quad\text{and}\quad T(cv)=cT(v)$$

>[!example] 
>

>Two vector spaces over the same field is isomorphic if and only if they has the same dimension.
