>A partially ordered set $(X,\le)$ is said to be *linearly ordered* (or *totally ordered*) if every two elements are comparable. The order $\le$ is then said to be a *linear order* (or a *total order*). The linear ordering is said to be a *strict linear ordering* (or a *strict total ordering*) if 
>$$a\le b\text{ and }b\le a\;\Rightarrow\; a=b,\text{ for }a,b\in X$$
