>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space and $D$ is a directed set. The *net* in topological space $(X,\tau)$ is a set $D$ together with a mapping $\Phi:D\to X$.^[[[Glen E. Bredon - Geometry and Topology.pdf#page=27|Glen E. Bredon - "Geometry and Topology" p.14]]]

>[!example]+ 
>A sequences is a net based on the set of natural numbers as an indexing set.
