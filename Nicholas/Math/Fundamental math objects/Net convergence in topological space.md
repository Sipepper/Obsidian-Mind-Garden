#### "Eventually in"
>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>If $\Phi:D\to X$ is a net in the topological space $X$ and $A\subset X$ then we say that $\Phi$ is *frequently* in $A$ if for any $\alpha\in D$ there is a $\beta\ge\alpha$ such that $\Phi(\beta)\in A$. It is said to be *eventually* in $A$ if there is an $\alpha\in D$ such that $\Phi(\beta)\in A$ for all $\beta\ge\alpha$.

#### Convergence
>[!dsn]+ Direct strict note
>A net $\Phi:D\to X$ is a topological space is said to *converge* to $x\in X$ if, for every neighbourhood $U\subset X$ of $x$, $\Phi$ is eventually in $U$.

>If a net $\Phi$ is eventually in two sets $U$ and $V$ then it is eventually in $U\cap V$. Also, this is impossible if $U\cap V=\emptyset$.
