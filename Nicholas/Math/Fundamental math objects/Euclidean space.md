>Let $(\mathbb{R}^{n},d)$ be a product set $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ of finite number of real lines equipped with the metric
>$$d(x,y)=\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-y_{i})^{2}}$$
>then such metric space is said to be *Euclidean*, and denoted as $\mathbb{E}^{n}$.

###### Topological properties
>- The euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^{n}$ has a basis which consists of products of open intervals 
>  $$\prod_{i=1}^{n}(a_{i},b_{i})\qquad a_{i}<b_{i}$$
>  by [[Euclidean topology]]
>- Space $\mathbb{E}^{n}$ can be viewed as a Hilbert space with the [[Euclidean inner product]].
