>Strictly speaking, suppose that $X$ is a set. A *sequence* is a mapping $f:\mathbb{N}\to X$, that is mapping of a natural numbers to $X$.^[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Последовательность]

>A *subsequence* of a sequence $\{x_{n}\}$ is a sequence dependant on $k$, that is $\{x_{n_{k}}\}$, which is contained in $\{x_{n}\}$. Here $n_{k}$ is a *growing sequence* of natural numbers, i.e. if $a<b$ then $n_{a}<n_{b}$.
