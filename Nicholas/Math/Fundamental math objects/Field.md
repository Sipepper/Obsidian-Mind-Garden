>Let $F$ be a set, on which we defined two algebraic operations multiplication - $(\cdot)$ and addition - $(+)$. If our set $F$ forms an abelian groups with respect to such operations and the following property holds $$a\cdot(b+c)=a\cdot b+a\cdot c,\quad\forall a,b,c\in F$$ then such set together with operations is called a *field*.

>In other words field is a commutative division ring.^[[Lectures at KAU - Yevgen Polulyakh](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OBF4iFXhiyJQ2lVaDTRnDEnyDf6hImIg)]

>Field is an integral domain.
>>[!proof]+
>>Let $a,b\in F$ and $a\cdot b=0$.
>>Suppose that $a\ne0$, then there exists $a^{-1}$ and
>>$$b=1\cdot b=(a^{1}\cdot b)\cdot b=a^{-1}\cdot(a\cdot b)=a^{-1}\cdot0=0$$

>[!example] 
>The set $\mathbb{Q}$ of all rational numbers has a field structure with respect to the default addition and multiplication.
