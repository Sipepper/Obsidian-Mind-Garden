>Let $F$ be a set, on which we defined two algebraic operations multiplication - $(\cdot)$ and addition - $(+)$. If our set $F$ forms an abelian groups with respect to such operations and the following property holds $$a\cdot(b+c)=a\cdot b+a\cdot c,\quad\forall a,b,c\in F$$ then such set together with operations is called a *field*.

>[!example] 
>The set $\mathbb{Q}$ of all rational numbers has a field structure with respect to the default addition and multiplication.
