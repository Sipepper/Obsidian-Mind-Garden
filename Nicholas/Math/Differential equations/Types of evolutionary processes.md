#### Deterministic evolutionary processes
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Evolutionary process is called *deterministic*, if all i'ts future and past states are determined by a current state.^[В.И. Арнольд - "Обыкновенные дифференциальные уравнения"]

>[!example] 
>- All processes in classical mechanics are deterministic.
>- As a not-example, moving particles in quantum mechanics is not a deterministic process.
>- Heat radiation in bodies is an example of *semi-determined* process, because future is determined by a current state, but past is not. 

#### Finite dimensional evolutionary processes
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Process is said to be *finite-dimensional*, if it has finite-dimensional phase space, i.e. if number of parameters to describe system is finite.^[В.И. Арнольд - "Обыкновенные дифференциальные уравнения"]

>[!example]
>- System of $n$ bodies in Newtotian mechanics, needs $6n$ parameters, if we describing a solid bodies and not material points, we will need $12n$ parameters.
>- Examples of *infinite dimensional* evolutionary spaces can be found in wave propagation in optics and acoustics.

#### Differentiable evolutionary processes
>[!dsn] Direct strict note
>Process is said to be *differentiable*, if it's phase space is a smooth manifold, and changes in states are described by differentiable functions.^[В.И. Арнольд - "Обыкновенные дифференциальные уравнения"]

>[!example]
>Points in mechanical system are changing in differentiable manner.
