>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $X$ and preserve the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Let $\mu$ be a finite(countably) additive measure on $\mathcal{A}$, such that $\mu(\gamma A)=\mu(A)$ for all $\gamma\in G$ and $A\in\mathcal{A}$, then measure $\mu$ is said to be $G$*-invariant*.^[Cornelia Drutu, Michael Kapovich - "Geometric group theory" p.4]
