>*Lebesgue measure* is a generalization of volume in $n$-dimensional euclidean spaces. Which is defined as 
>$$\mathcal{L}^{n}(A)=\inf\left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\text{vol}^{n}(A_{i}):A\subseteq\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i} \right\}$$
>where $A_{i}$ are $n$-dimensional parallelopipeds with $n$-dimensional "volume" 
>$$\text{vol}^{n}(A)=(b_{1}-a_{1})(b_{2}-a_{2})\dots(b_{n}-a_{n})$$
>i.e. we taking infimum on covering by open parallelopipeds of a set $A$.^[Kenneth Falconner - "Fractal Geometry 2e." p.13-14]
