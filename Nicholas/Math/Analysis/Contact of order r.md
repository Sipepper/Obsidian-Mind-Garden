>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $C^{\infty}(M,N)$ denote the set of all smooth maps $M\to N$, $f$ and $g\in C^{\infty}(M,N)$, and $p$ be a point in $M$. Then $f$ is said to have *contact of order* $r$ with $g$ at $p$, written $f\sim_{r}g$, if $D^{k}f(p)=D^{k}g(p)$ for every $k=0,1,\dots,r$.^[[[A. Mukherjee - Differential Topology.pdf#page=237 | A. Mukherjee - "Differential Topology" p.227]]]
