#### Analysis operator
>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Let $\phi_{1},\dots,\phi_{m}$ be a family of vectors in Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. Then the *analysis operator* related to such family is an operator defined as
>$$\forall x\in\mathcal{H}\quad Tx=(\langle x,\phi_{1} \rangle, \langle x,\phi_{2} \rangle, \dots,\langle x,\phi_{m} \rangle )$$
>Such coordinates are often called the *frame coordinates*.^[need clarification, as it was translated from ukrainian and maybe more correct term is present]^[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hv-307HKiOl3tHpbtUAnYbDydBKfGcJD]

#### Synthesis operator
>[!dsn]+ Definition
>Consider an operator $T^{*}$ adjoint to synthesis operator $T$. Then if 
>$$\begin{align}T^{*}:l_{2}^{m}&\to\mathcal{H}\\ T^{*}(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\dots,\alpha_{m})&=\alpha_{1}\phi_{1}+\alpha_{2}\phi_{2}+\dots+\alpha_{m}\phi_{m}\in\mathcal{H} \end{align}$$
>then $T^{*}$ is said to be the *synthesis operator*.
