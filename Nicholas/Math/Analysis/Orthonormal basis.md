>Let $H$ be a Hilbert space. A set $S\subset H$ is said to be *orthonormal* if $\|u\|_{H}=1$ and $(u,v)_{H}=0$ for all $u,v\in S$ such that $u\ne v$.
>
>If $S$ is not contained in any other orthonormal set, its said to be a *orthonormal basis* for $H$.^[Fabio Silva Botelho - "Functional analysis and applied opmitization in banach spaces" p.36]
