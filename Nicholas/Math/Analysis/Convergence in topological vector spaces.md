>Let $U$ be a topological vector space. A sequence $\{u_{n}\}$ *converges* to an element $u_{0}\in U$, if for every neighbourhood $V$ of $u_{0}$, there exists a natural number $N$ suh that
>$$u_{n}\in V\quad\forall n\ge N$$.^[Botelho - Functional Analysis and Applied Optimization in Banach Spaces p.9]
