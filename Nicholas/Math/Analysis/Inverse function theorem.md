>[!dsn]+ Theorem
>Suppose $U$ and $V$ are open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and $F:U\to V$ is a smooth function. If $DF(a)$ is invertible at some point $a\in U$, then there exist connected neighborhoods $U_{0}\subseteq U$ of $a$ and $V_{0}\subseteq V$ of $F(a)$ such that $F|_{U_{0}}:U_{0}\to V_{0}$ is a diffeomorphism.^[[[John M. Lee - Introduction to smooth manifolds.pdf#page=675 |John M. Lee - "Introduction to smooth manifolds" p.657 ]]]
