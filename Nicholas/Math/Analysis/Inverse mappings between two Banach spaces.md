>[!dsn] Direct Strict note
>Every continuous linear bijective mapping between two Banach spaces has an continuous inverse.^[Fabio Silva Botelho - "Functional analysis and applied optimization in Banach spaces" c.30]

>[!proof]
>Let $A:U\to V$ be such mapping, i.e. continuous linear bijection. Because $A$ is also an open mapping, then $A^{-1}$ will be continuous.
