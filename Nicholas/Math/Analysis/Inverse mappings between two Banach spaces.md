# Inverse mappings between two Banach spaces

>[!dsn]+ Proposition
>Every continuous linear bijective mapping between two Banach spaces has an continuous inverse.^[[[Fabio Silva Botelho - Functional Analysis and Applied Optimization in Banach Spaces.pdf#page=48|Fabio Silva Botelho - "Functional analysis and applied optimization in Banach spaces" p.30]]]

>[!proof]+
>Let $A:U\to V$ be such mapping, i.e. continuous linear bijection. Because $A$ is also an open mapping, then $A^{-1}$ will be continuous.
