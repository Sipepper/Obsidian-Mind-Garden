>Encryption is a fundamental concept of cryptography. It's a process of transforming data in order to make it *confidential*. It's consists of algorithm called a *cipher* and a secret value called the *key*.^[[[Jean-Philippe Aumasson - Serious Cryptography - A Practical Introduction to Modern Encryption.pdf#page=25|Jean-Philippe Aumasson - "Serious Cryptography - A Practical Introduction to Modern Encryption" p.1]]]

>If you don't know the secret key you can't decrypt nor can you learn any bit of information from encrypted message.

>There are two types of encryption
>- *Symmetric encryption*, in which the key used to decrypt is the same as the key used to encrypt, and
>- *Asymetric encryption*(or *pulblic-key encryption*) in which the key used to decrypt is different from the key used to encrypt. 

>An unencrypted message is called the *plaintext* and encrypted message is called the *ciphertext*.

>The ciphertexts is always longer or equal in length to plaintexts.
