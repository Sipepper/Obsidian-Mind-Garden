# Comments in Rust

###### tags: #Программирование/Rust

Comments in Rust begin with two slashes `//`
```rust
//Fix the game
```
If we need more than one rows for a comment before each row we must write `//`
```rust
//It sucks playing this shit
//and i fking addicted
```
Comments can be added after code
```rust
fn main() {
	let sus = 43;//sus
}
```
as well as between
```rust
fn main() {
	//put dispenser here
	let dispenser = 234.53f32;
}
```
